thank you ! ksduck / originally posted below dried apples versus cholesterol quoting from “ green tea does not inhibit iron absorption ” published 2009 in the international journal of cardiology , “ the only reference that i could find in the literature about a negative effect of tea drinking on iron absorption came from tunisia . but the experiment was carried out on rats . therefore , unless you are a rat and a rat in tunisia , you should not worry about development of iron deficiency anemia from tea drinking . ” in 2008 , though , a study in india found that drinking tea with meals could cut iron absorption in half . this is a function of publication delays . the cardiology journal piece was published in 2009 but was written in 2007 , before the india study surfaced . the good news , though , is that the study found that vitamin c triples iron absorption , so as long as you ’ re drinking tea with lemon , or eating vitamin c rich foods at your meals ( like citrus , broccoli , tropical fruits , bell peppers , etc . ) then this shouldn ’ t be an issue . if , however , you don ’ t like lemon ( and lemon in coffee ? yuck ! ) and aren ’ t eating these kinds of foods , then menstruating women may want to lay off tea and coffee ( and cocoa and peppermint tea ) during meals and up to an hour before to maximize iron absorption . in men ( and nonmenstruating women ) , the reduction of iron absorption may not necessarily be a bad thing . in fact , the effect of coffee on iron absorption has been used to explain why coffee consumption has been found to be protective against diseases tied with iron overload such as diabetes and gout . for a related phenomenon , see my video new mineral absorption enhancers found and the accompanying blog post how to enhance mineral absorption. anything new on the green tea preventing iron absorption ? i went to a nutritionist lately and she recommended that i should not drink green tea 2h before and after meals. so that gives me like a 30 minutes window , twice a day ? that sounded insane to me , but who am i to contradict my nutritionist. so digging a bit since , i found a myriad of contradicting informations. i ’ d love to have your update on this , if there is any.thank yousame here ! i have received the same information simon received from his nutritionist . i ’ m puzzled.http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / cont … here is a research study related to green tea ’ s antioxidant properties and iron absorption.although it did decrease absorption , it was not a complete block of nonheme iron , but a partial block . it appears to have a 27 % reduction in iron absorption.my friend told me that when he went become a vegetarian , his hematocrit levels were lower . now they were not life threatening but they were lower around 39 % . i am a vegan cyclist and we need a high ht levels to compete . i want and need high like 45-48 ht levels . can you tape a podcast about vegan athletes and hematocrit levels ? i ’ m in the same boat jared . i just became anemic over the past 8 months . thought my multivitamin had iron – wrong . now what ? http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 73 / 3 / 607.short here is a research study related to green tea ’ s antioxidant properties and iron absorption.just don ’ t drink anything at least 15 minutes before any meal and wait at least an hour after a meal – drinking anything while eating is bad.spot on , you shouldn ’ t have more than a small cup of fluid to wash down a meal .. this is why its important to carry around drinks with you , so you can be hydrated before meals and why hibiscus tea is a good choice , so it doesn ’ t interfere with mineral absorption .. could we shift the focus to zinc absorption ? getting less iron and less copper could be good because they both fuel oxidation . but zinc acts as an anti-oxidant , right ? so how do the tannins in tea affect zinc absorption ? and i ’ ll add this to the discussion : a study suggesting that the tannins may actually enhance our zinc uptake. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20546406anybody want to join this discussion ? nice information ! any updates on this ? i ’ m 23 , and was turned down for donating blood because my hemoglobin was at 11.4 ( and it needs to be at 12.5 ) . they sent me home with a deferral letter , which had tips on the back for increasing dietary iron ( meats , raisins , spinach , apricots , vitamin-c rich foods , etc . ) , and said “ tea contains tannins , which will decrease the absorption of iron . ” since this came from the red cross , i assume that it ’ s legitimate and well-supported , but i ’ m starting to second guess that.thoughts ?

401	what are the best sources of vitamin k ? i have read in a magazine that there are several types of vitamin k. according to the article , vitamin k1 is found in vegetables . vitamin k2 mk7 is found in meat , fish and eggs . the article also said that vitamin k1 is stored in the liver for only one hour , time not enough to perform all its tasks . on the contrary , vitamin k2 mk7 would stay in the liver for the whole day . so my question is : should vegetarians take supplements of vitamin k2 mk7 ( created from natto ) ? vjimener / originally posted below better than green tea ? not sure what magazine you were reading , but the scientific consensus is that either one ( phylloquinone or menaquinone , formerly k1 and k2 ) is fine for maintaining human vitamin k status . the recommended intake is about 100 mcg . a half cup of kale ? > 500 . no need for natto ; just eat your greens . in fact dark green leafies are so packed with vitamin k that if you ’ re on the drug coumadin ( warfarin ) , a drug that works by poisoning vitamin k metabolism , you have to closely work with your physician to titrate the dose to your greens intake so as to not undermine the drug ’ s effectiveness ! learn more about the wonders of greens in my 25 videos ( like eating green to prevent cancer ) and kale in particular in videos such as smoking versus kale juice and kale and the immune system . isn ’ t vitamin k1 distinct from k2 . k1 plays an important role in coagulation . k2 plays a role in directing where calcium gets stored . too much calcium in the blood can cause calcification , k2 helps direct the calcium to the bones . if that is true , don ’ t we need to satisfy our requirements for k2 specifically ? sounds like we would need to be getting some natto after all.mk4 isn ’ t same as mk7 either. both are k2 , but different formsi like natto bec it is fermented and the vitamin k2 from natto is a nice bonus . i have been able to find low salt natto bec i don ’ t like any added salt . i have already decided to get rid of miso since i cannot find low salt miso.i was reading k2 and calcium paradox and it indicates the only non-animal source of k2 is natto ( which i don ’ t like ) . it also says k2 is not the same vitamin as k1 .. ie . k2 prevents atherosclerosis , diabetes 2 , cancer , and osteoporosis , etc , whereas k1 only helps with blood clotting . i tried researching on internet if this is true or quackery .. i don ’ t believe everything i read .. but so far have not found information on sites i would consider trustworthy.i think the research that michael cited is out of date ( published in 2009 ) . i would suggest people read the review article “ the role of menaquinones ( vitamin k2 ) in human health ” published in the cambridge journal of nutrition in 2013 . it states that vitamin k2 has an important and distinct role in bone health . it also provides evidence that absorption of k2 produced by intestinal bacteria is very inefficient ( because the k2 producing bacteria are located in the colon whereas k2 absorption happens in the small intestine ) . therefore it recommends that everyone take a form of k2 every day , either from natto , animal products or supplements . ( i ’ ve been taking a vegan k2 supplement sold by vitacost.com ) .http : / / journals.cambridge.org / action / displayabstract ; jsessionid = 8485084ec3b24de5762b43fb087a1fbf.journals ? frompage = online & aid = 8894242menadione ( k2 ) is a metabolite of oral phylloquinone ( k1 ) , though only 5-25 % is converted . in rats , at least , this conversion isn ’ t dependent on gut bacteria.my understanding , so far , is that a couple cups of greens a day is enough for most requirements , but in as yet unproven therapies ( like reducing vacular calcification ) , high , supplemental doses of free k2 , preferably in oil emulsion , may be required.i am really surprised to see someone claim that the bacteria in the colon are different species than what you find in the intestines . doesn ’ t pass the smell test.i strongly believe that vegan it is only possible to take profit from a vegan diet , rich in many useful nutrients , if we don ’ t turn a blind eye towards the downsides of not eating meat . such as vit d , vit b12 , possibly vitamine k ( 2 ) and who knows are there more … vegans seem to have so much benefits , yet , no higher life expectancy proves that we are still missing some pieces of the puzzle , wood you agree to that ? so i am looking beyond what is served to me today . — – maybe i found something here : i ( 53 ) have been taking natto for a few weeks now and , waaw before , being a vegan for over a year now , i can solve some of my healthissues but found it hard to make my bloodpressure move just a little bit … .. eating natto , my bloodpressure 140 / 90 ( 150 / 100without medication ) just dropped to 110 / 80 ( 95 / 60 by moments ) . waaw , this is not food , just a table spoon every day does more then medication . i am impressed . yet it is not a structural solution to my high blood pressure.when i stop eating for a few days my bp goes up again.as for the longterm effects of other components in natto , they remain to be seen , i am hopeful however to reduce some calcification in my arteries by eating natto . more and more research from the past 10 years starts to indicate that it might be possible.k1 ( vegetables ) and k2 ( from natto ) may have the same value in terms of directing calcium form our arteries towards our bones , k2 stays in our blood for days whereas k1 seems to be eliminated after few hours , hence we should eat tonnes of green leaves to keep up a certain level of k1 in our blood , while a tablespoon of natto every day can do the trick 10 times better . ( btw , i am not producer or selling natto : ) ) dr. william li says one can get high amounts of k2 from natto but most westerners hate it . he says you can get large amounts of k2 from gouda , ementhal cheese , l jarlsberg and edam cheese . he says it helps prevent cancer , prevents heart disease , by keeping arteries flexible , helps deposit calcium in bones instead of blood vessels . i am hoping that dr. gregor might comment on this.same story here , impressive research and results.i throw a chuck of frozen natto through kale / red cabbage / spinach vegetable shakes , as long as there are some peanuts in there and or strawberries it gets to be quite tasty to me . these two ingredients really transform the blend from an atrocity into something much much better ^ ^ .vitamin k2 is known to lower blood pressure , hense your results with natto ! http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15514282very interesting study , i wonder if there are more studies like this showing that vitamin k2 might have more benefits than regular k vitamin ? dr greger , i would much appreciate if you would dig further into this whole k2 business . there are a lot of claims out there about this “ super vitamin ” .google cees vermneer , he has devoted his career researching this vitamin. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / ? term = vermeer % 20c % 5bauth % 5dthis should give a good impression of his involvement withing the studies involving k family of vitamins.i ’ ll be eating natto till the day i die . ; ) this study is probably only applicable to omnivores- they ’ re already at risk for heart disease , and were no doubt the subjects of the study . phylloquinone in a vegan diet may be adequate for the low-risk vegan , especially when you factor in the menaquinone produced by bacteria in our small intestines. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 1492156any comment about the fact that natto is also replete with b12 ? your assessment of vitamin k2 is wrong . read wikipedia on k2 and the “ calcium paradox ” . if you want to go vegan , you must supplement k2 , zinc , taurine and b-12 . your vegan bias is making you look ridiculous . i ’ ve seen you dismissed as a vegan fanatic . i agree with most of your assessments , but not that we get enough k2 from k1 and vegetables . calcium from any source without k2 can land in our arteries instead of our bones . its what ’ s responsible for “ hardening of the arteries ” and high blood pressure because the walls of the arteries become less elastic . start posting results from european publications and knock off your america only bias . read the commentators on this topic.you know what you are talking about.i ’ m not sure about taurine yet ( still doing my own research , i know it is made in our bodies from cysteine which we can get from plant sources like soy , but maybe we don ’ t get enough or it isn ’ t converted enough ? ) , but it would explain why a lot of vegans i know go grey early.add vitamin d to your list and that should be all the supplements you need to take.i believe we should always look at the evolutionary science when it comes to our diets . while we are related to chimps the most , we did come from gorillas ( technically it was a gorilla ancestor that no longer exists , but you get the point ) . gorillas eat bugs like termites ( chimps eat termites too , but they also eat meat ) .and what do termites have ? b12 and k2 in their guts ( they have special bacteria to break down wood ) .and bugs have a high mineral content . for example , mealworms are high in zinc ( take that with a grain of salt , finding reliable nutrition information on bugs is hard , even with the internet ) . and vegans tend to be deficient in minerals like zinc , calcium , and iron . but of the three , i believe zinc is the only one of real concern.and of course we get our vitamin d from being in the sun . and maybe taurine from insects ? i ’ m not sure.so this solves the mystery behind almost all the deficiencies in a vegan diet ( if you are wondering about omega-3 , i ’ ve seen some recent studies saying vegans have enough epa and dha in their blood from only consuming ala sources and gorillas eat dark greens , which have some omega-3 , throughout the day . we definitely need more research on humans , but gorillas seem to do just fine on ala . so unless you eat dark greens 24 / 7 , eat your flax at a minimum ) .so it is either bugs or supplements.dr. greger , we ’ ve seen your videos on bugs . we know you think they are a good source of nutrition . but please do a video on the following topics and let us know of any studies you think we are missing : vitamin k2 zinc ( please do an update saying if we can get enough from just vegan whole foods , because i don ’ t see the math working out , at least not for men ) taurinestill , i ’ m very grateful for all the hard work you ’ ve done . thank you dr. greger ( and his volunteers ) ! ! ! i spoke too soon on the zinc issue . it is possible , but you do have to eat a lot ( which i do ) .per veganhealth.org , you need 11 mg for a male and 8 for a female . before you say vegans absorb less , the study cited in the link above showed vegans having pretty much the same levels as meat eaters.pulling data from nutritiondata.self.com , i put my usual meals to the testbreakfast : 4 cups of brown rice ( cooked ) : 4.8 mg 1 cup of black beans ( cooked ) : 1.9 mglunch : salad ( ignored ) apple with 2 tbs of peanut butter : 0.9 mgdinner : 1 cup oatmeal ( cooked ) : 2.3 mg 1 cup sweet potatoes : 0.6 mgthat gets me to 10.5 mg . when you add all the other misc stuff i also eat ( mostly fruit and nuts ) , i ’ m sure i get the other 0.5 mg.alwaysworking - > a thought provoking response . what dr greger has on vitamin k was the scientific consensus as of 2008 . it needs updating . taurine acts as a calcium channel blocker , which is an important function , since calcium build-up is toxic inside the cell , hence the need for magnesium to keep it in solution in the blood stream . my research shows calcium metabolism to be the determiner of aging . it is used to patch up our organs until the organs can no longer function.my multi-vitamin has 30mg of zinc which is 2x the rda . as you note , vitamin d3 is extremely important in its role in calcium metabolism . it gets calcium from the gut into the blood stream . k2 takes over from there . more d3 is being added to multi-vitamins . i hope to see more references to cochrane meta-studies which much more weight than selecting individual studies to highlight . as far as supplements – a multi-vitamin , vitamin d3 in the winter and omega-3s from fish oil or algae should suffice.blindspots ? why isn ’ t this being addressed and why is such an outdated take on vitamin k being presented ? it is so important to not only point out the strengths of a vegan diet but the weaknesses.it appears that there is more recent info on the cvd impacts of vitamin k2 . i ’ ve been on a very low fat wfpb vegan diet for 2 years yet my ct calcium score increased from 152 to 221 event though my ldl is 70 , hdl 43 . clearly there are other factors at play . you rarely mention ldl particle size which may be a more important indictor than ldl-c . vitamin k2 may prove to be as crucial for vegans as b12 since only poorly absorbed k1 is present in the copious leafy greens i eat . please address these head on.hello , dear community ! in wikipedia , it says that cooked collard greens contain more vitamin k ( 1 ) than raw collard greens . why is that so ? thank you ! hello everyone ! i read more and more articles saying vitamin k2 is critical for health and that our body is not producing enough of it . is that true ? do i need to supplement with vitamin k2 ? nope . please see above . - - -

403	dairy and ear infections : is there an association ? hi doc . any research studies on dairy consumption and ear infections in children . my friend ’ s child had numerous ear infections and i recommended soy milk instead of cows milk plus to eliminate cheese , ice cream , etc . she asked a chief pediatric ent at a big hospital who of course said there is no connection . of course , if there were he wouldn ’ t make as much money so i ’ m sure he wouldn ’ t push that subject to anybody . this child incidentally was on numerous rounds of antibiotics and may have tubes inserted in her ears . i thought she should give it a try . thanks eric . ericjay / originally asked on the nutritionfacts.org facebook page the association between cow milk exposure and recurrent ear infections in susceptible children has been documented for 50 years . though there are rare cases of pathogens in milk causing ear infections directly ( then meningitis ) , the link is thought to be due to milk allergies . in fact there ’ s a respiratory disease called heiner syndrome , a lung disease of infants primarily caused by milk consumption that can cause ear infections . though milk allergy most often results in respiratory , gastrointestinal , and skin symptoms , as many as 1 in 500 may suffer speech delay due to chronic inner ear inflammation . for 40 years there ’ s been a recommendation to try “ a 3 month trial on a strict cow ’ s milk elimination diet ” for children with recurrent ear infections , but dr. benjamin spock , probably the most respected pediatrician of all time , ended up recommending a life-long elimination of cow ’ s milk . see my video : doctors ’ nutritional ignorance . i am 26 years old and still getting ear infections . when i was younger i had tubes put in multiple times and my ear drums have ruptured several times due to infection . i do not drink cows milk . i have been drinking almond milk for years . is there anything else i can do to prevent infection ? should i cut dairy out all together ? dairy is dairy carissa , whether is comes from milk or cheese.i had the same carissa , after years of fighting with antibiotics off and on as an adult , one instance i even became allergy to one of the antibiotics because they kept putting me on it , i changed docs … an ear specialist then told me to use hydrogen peroxide when ever i get a ‘ hint ’ that an infection is coming . i do and gratefully i haven ’ t had an actual full blown ear infection for 10 years . i put a cap full in my ear with my head resting on the sink , wait until it is done bubbling , then turn my head and let it drain , i think have a blue bulb syringe with warm water waiting to wash it out . i was told by an allergy doctor that alot of times there is ‘ dampness ’ created in the ear due to allergies , this dampness gets the fungus or bacteria growing . he advised to avoid environmental allergens , i didn ’ t really know i had one but put an air cleaner in my bedroom anyway and it has helped tremendously ! yes , and cut out the dairy , it is a major allergenhave you tryed chiropractic ? i ’ m allergic to milk . which basically means i ’ m allergic to whey . you will be shocked to discover what all whey is added to . and yes , dairy should be cut out and only ingested moderately on special occasions , and depending on other allergies and current tolerance level you may regret , you may not . i have no trouble with raw milk . i honestly believe it ’ s the pasteurization process that does something . but anything with whey , sends me over the cliff . also , you may have other food allergies that are contributing as well . i have chronic allergies and foods that i have to avoid and moderate strictly are dairy , whey , corn , wheat , yeast , talc , msg , corn syrup , strawberries , apples … so pretty much anything processed ! but , i have learned to listen to my body . itchy ears , wet ears , too dry ears , tingly tongue , all these are signs and i stay flushing with water and watch food intake and i use an allergy ear drop . depending , i may swig a little benadryl before bed just to help everything calm down.i would say that dairy is dairy and yes you better quit it all , at least for a trial period ( for 1-2 months for ex ) hi dr greger , i am a nutritionist and love your website but i am having trouble articulating what the epidemiological evidence is against dairy . i understand that saturated animal fat is bad , i understand that allergies are prevalent in some populations and that it contributes to ibs . i know that osteoporosis is the same in vegan and non vegan populations . what i cant explain is why nonfat milk and yoghurt is an unhealthy choice for people who do not have any allergies or intolerances . can you also please direct me to some papers- i have had lots of trouble researching this myself as finding and independent author is very difficult . kind regards , and many thanks for your wonderful site.melhello mel , it is good to see that a nutritionist such as yourself is trying to advocate a plant based diet . i applaud you as we need much more people like you out there . now to your primary questiondairy is a rich source of xenoestrogenshttp : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dairy-sexual-precocity / and can elevate igf-1 levels due to consuming high protein animal foodshttp : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = igf-1for these reasons it is strongly advised by dr. greger and others who follow the research to avoid dairy . if you click on the “ sources cited ” section you will find the papers you are looking for.watch the movie fork over knives.try reading the china studyhere is a write up on dairya review published in the journal of pediatrics focused on the benefits of dairy “ the findings of epidemiologic and prospective studies have raised questions about the efficacy of the use of dairy products for the promotion of bone health . ” after a review of the existing literature and finding “ a positive relationship between dairy product consumption and measures of bone health in children or young adults was reported in 1 of 4 cross-sectional studies ; in 0 of 3 retrospective studies ; in 0 of 1 prospective study ; and in 2 of 3 randomized , controlled trials . only 1 of these randomized clinical trials adequately controlled for vitamin d intake , and it showed no significant effect of dairy products on bmd [ bone mineral density ] ” , they concluded , “ scant evidence supports nutrition guidelines focused specifically on increasing milk or other dairy product intake for promoting child and adolescent bone mineralization . ” http : / / pediatrics.aappublications.org / content / 115 / 3 / 736.longa meta-analysis published in the british medical journal found , “ the small effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral density in the upper limb is unlikely to reduce the risk of fracture , either in childhood or later life , to a degree of major public health importance . ” and “ the authors concluded that the literature did not support recommendations for consumption of dairy products for bone health end points in children and young adults … our quantitative systematic review confirms this conclusion ” the authors also state , “ our results also do not support the premise that any type of calcium supplementation is more effective than another . ” even studies that used intakes of 1400 mg per day of calcium showed no benefit.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1602024 / ? tool = pubmedan editorial accompanying this meta-analysis pointed out , “ populations that consume the most cow ’ s milk and other dairy products have among the highest rates of osteoporosis and hip fracture in later life . given this fact , it is important to ask whether sufficient evidence exists to continue assuming that consumption of these foods is part of the solution . ” they concluded “ it is time to revise our calcium recommendations for young people and change our assumptions about the role of calcium , milk , and other dairy products in the bone health of children and adolescents . while the policy experts work on revising recommendations , doctors and other health professionals should encourage children to spend time in active play or sports , and to consume a nutritious diet built from whole foods from plant sources to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and provide an environment conducive to building strong bones . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1602030 / a review published in the american journal of clinical nutrition of the research on the effects of dairy products on bone health found 57 studies , and of these , 21 studies were considered to have stronger-evidence , worthy of inclusion in this review . “ of 21 stronger-evidence studies , 57 % were not significant , 29 % were favorable , and 14 % were unfavorable . ” keep in mind that the majority of these studies were funded by the dairy industry , and even with this natural bias and influence to produce positive outcomes , no better than 29 % of the studies were favorable to bone health . one of the studies that showed unfavorable results that was funded by the dairy industry showed some shocking outcomes . the findings showed post menopause subjects who received the extra milk ( three 8 ounce glasses of skimmed milk daily ) for a yearlost more bone than those who didn ’ t drink the extra milk . the authors wrote , “ the protein content of the milk supplement may have a negative effect on calcium balance , possibly through an increase in kidney losses of calcium or through a direct effect on bone resorption … this may have been due to the average 30 percent increase in protein intake during milk supplementation . ” skim milk is very high in protein so this is unavoidable unless one is to consume the very fatty whole milk in which 2-5 % of the fat content is trans fat and is very high in saturated fat.http : / / www.ajcn.org / content / 72 / 3 / 681.longhttp : / / www.ajcn.org / content / 41 / 2 / 254.longits evidence such as this that i am unconvinced calcium should be from cows milk . long term studies on vegan bone density comparing the omnivores diet showed the same bone density “ … although vegans have much lower intakes of dietary calcium and protein than omnivores , veganism does not have an adverse effect on bone mineral density and does not alter body composition . ” the vegan participants had been on a vegan diet an average of 33 years.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19350341i find it interesting that modern society believes that the human species is dependent on the milk of another animal species . the primary biologic purpose of cow ’ s milk is to grow a 60 pound calf to a 600 pound cow in less than 8 months . this is no way natural to humans , as cow ’ s milk has high concentrations of protein , potassium , sodium , calcium , and other nutrients to sustain rapid growth . in comparison , these nutrients are at a three to four times lower concentration in human milk than cow ’ s milk . milk is used to promote growth , so how is this natural as human adults to be consuming milk , let alone another species of animals milk ? dairy products promote the secretion of insulin like growth factor . this spike in igf-1 is the most likely source of positive bone growth in the studies showing favorable outcomes of dairy on bones , not necessarily the calcium . elevated igf-1 does more harm than good in adults , it promotes tumor growth in breast , prostate , lung , and colon cells and accelerates the aging process.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12417786http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0531556505001609the consumption of dairy in children has resulted in earlier puberty . “ the effect of animal protein intake , which was associated with an earlier puberty onset , might mainly be due to dairy . “ an earlier puberty onset has been related to an increased risk for hormone-related cancers in adulthood . for example , a meta-analysis of 26 epidemiological studies reported a9 % risk reduction for breast cancer with every additional year at menarche . additionally , recent study results demonstrated that a 1-y delay in menarche was associated with a 2.4 to 4.5 % lower total mortality.http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 140 / 3 / 565.longthe concern with dairy and hormone dependent cancer is something to think about as well . it has been shown that consuming dairy significantly increases circulating steroid hormones in woman and that vegetarians have far less of this hormone . “ in conclusion , greater consumption of red meat and dairy products might influence circulating concentrations of shbg and estradiol , respectively . given the well-established role of steroid hormones in breast cancer etiology for postmenopausal women , these findings may have important health implications ” tumor growth from these hormone imbalances is also evident “ a dramatic increase in estrogen-dependent malignant diseases , such as ovarian , corpus uteri , breast , testicular and prostate cancers has been recognized . ganmaa et al. investigated the incidence and mortality of testicular and prostate cancers in relation to dietary practices . among various food items , cow ’ s milk and cheese had the highest correlation with incidence and mortality rate of these cancers ” children are at high risk “ among the exposure of humans , especially prepubertal children , to exogenous estrogens , we are particularly concerned with ” these xenoestrogens from lactating preganant cattle ( the majority of commercial cattle used for milk ) significantly raised estrogen levels in male adults and reduced testosterone levels and did even more so in children . this is significant since these estrogens have mutagenic affects “ toxicological and epidemiological studies have indicated that e2 could be categorized as a carcinogen . milk is considered to be a rich source of estrogens . ” indeed , e2 concentration is higher in mammary drainage than in the peripheral circulation in high yielding cows . ” http : / / missclasses.com / mp3s / prize % 20cd % 202010 / vegetarians / hormonal % 20differences.pdfhttp : / / missclasses.com /

foods themselves become the mucus as part of the digestive process . the other major culprit is flour products . in kindergarten we all learned to make paste from flour and water . any grain will do . paste made from dairy , flour , rice , soy or red meat is still paste or glue . once in the body , they slime it up right to the cellular level . one of the places it ends up is in the middle ear where it can build up and fill the mastoid and the inner ear canal . if left too long , infection sets in and eventually the infection dissolves the skull between the middle ear and the brain . then the brain fluid leaks into the middle ear and then you have meningitis and life may no longer be worth living . non-mucus forming foods are vegetables and fruit , not including potatoes.dr. gregor has stated that medical authorities have known about the link between dairy and ear infections for fifty ears but the reality is that i found a chapter devoted to this in an american medical textbook at a fleamarket . that book was published in 1938 . so as of this writing the medical community has been on record as knowing about this for ninety five years.what the chapter i read was discussing was that the incidence of ear infections has jumped since the introduction of pasteurization.what that really means is that after pasteurization , the milk people were drinking was dead milk as opposed to live milk . live milk is not mucus forming and is digested more completely than pasteurized milk.modern humans have existed for 200,000 years . we didn ’ t start eating grain on a regular basis until about 12,000 years ago and 9,000 years for dairy.what that tells you is that our bodies have not yet evolved sufficiently to digest those materials properly . some people can , most can ’ t even though they don ’ t know they can ’ t.archaeologists have determined that after the inclusion of grain in the human diet , life expectancy went down , people were shorter and sicker.my own research on the internet shows that after pasteurization of milk products , life expectancy went up but all high dairy populations have gotten magnificently sicker with a far wider range of illnesses than ever before . the life expectancies in modern times have not been reduced due to other factors . if nothing else had changed – such as medical care , refrigeration , dental care , transportation and safer living circumstances , lives would certainly have shortened.at this point , humans while having become the only species to develop great medical care have become the sickest species by far on the entire planet due to dairy and flour product consumption.dogs and cats now get the same diseases we do because we feed them foods high in dairy and grain products.osteoporosis is highest in countries with high dairy consumption . end of story.fat is an important energy source . fat is not bad if you burn what you eat . but today most people do less that one eighth the amount of exercise their forebears did . so instead of burning fat we accumulate it.what has not been considered here is the role of constipation in how the body handles dairy , flour , meat and sugar . not well.dairy causes constipation as do refined flour and meat because there is no fibre and because of the adhesive properties of dairy and flour . mix all of those things together in the small intestine and you have a recipe for clogging up the plumbing in your body from head to toe . that over time causes blockages in every organ and cell you have . i call it systemic constipation . doctors don ’ t call it anything because they ’ ve never heard or thought of the concept.whatever gets clogged first , that creates symptoms . now you or your children have an ear infection and that is what it ’ s called , not systemic constipation . you can apply that concept to any degenerative disease known to man and be correct.asking the main beneficiary of your problem for an alternative solution to the one he is offering is rather silly of course . i wonder if you can sue him for giving bad advice.hi everybody . i was wondering if somebody can help me with autoinmune inner ear disease recently diagnosed to me … since last year , may . i have some noises in my left ear . annoying . and the right one seems to be congested . some solution to this . i will appreciate some comment or solutiondr . greger : “ as many as 1 in 500 may suffer speech delay due to chronic inner ear inflammation ” speech impairment due to intermittent ear infection can now be be addressed . my oldest son ’ s time to process sound such as “ buh ” decreased from 490 ms to normal ( 10 ms ) , but it took an intensive , expensive 4-month intervention . worth every minute and penny , imho , to speed his processing of sound so he could develop normal language patterns ! ( my children spent early years in overseas orphanage where they had insufficient exposure to adult speech , but most / many kids have impaired auditory processing due to intermittent ear infection . ) the original research : michael m. merzenich , william m. jenkins , paul johnston , christoph schreiner , steven l. miller , and paula tallal . temporal processing deficits of language-learning impaired children ameliorated by training . science 5 january 1996 271 : 77-81 [ doi : 10.1126 / science.271.5245.77 ] version 2 of the program is described here : http : / / www.scilearn.com / products / fast-forword / language-series / language .you may have heard of merzenich ’ s brain plasticity research : my understanding is that there is no upper age limit for training brain to process sound at normal speed.dr. greger , i find no references to tinnitus throughout your work here . is tinnitus something that can be alleviated nutritionally ? i am closer to hypotensive than hypertensive , and damaged the aural system with loud music and gunfire in my youth / young adulthood . i now protect them at every opportunity with the best earplugs i have found.hi wade . you ’ e right , nothing on tinnitus . i searched and found some research that looks into diet , here . it claimed many patients with tinnitus demonstrated abnormalities that could be addressed by dietary management , but of course only a few were followed . perhaps not enough research to know for sure , but there seems to be a connection with metabolic disorders . women who went on a lower calorie diet seemed to experience improvements with ear pressure . i would suggest a healthful diet to help prevent or avoid developing diseases like type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and other common cardiovascular risk factors ( high cholesterol , high triglycerides ) . that could be helpful . gosh i hope that helps a bit . good luck i hope you find some relief . let me know if i can dig further . - - -
404	is moringa ( moringa oleifera ) good for you ? a booth at our farmers ’ market is selling moringa . it is a nutrient based plant , exceptional supplementation . it is touted to be “ nature ’ s perfect food . ” . opinions please . judy0520 / originally asked on the nutritionfacts.org facebook page i had to look that one up ! i assume they ’ re talking about moringa oleifera . there are a few in vitro studies ( meaning in a test tube or petri dish outside of the body ) showing that leaf extracts may have antiproliferative effects on human cancer cells ( as has been shown with cabbage and onion family vegetables – see my # 1 anticancer vegetable video ) . and of course there have been nonhuman animal studies but i was unable to find any clinical studies ( meaning done with actual people ) . based on nutrition analyses it appears to be quite nutritious , though : in comparison with other foods , various parts of moringa oleifera have more iron than spinach ( 5.3-28.2 mg vs 2.7 mg in spinach ) , more vitamin c than oranges ( 120-220 mg vs 69.7 mg per orange ) , and more potassium than bananas ( 1324 mg vs 422 mg per banana ) . the calcium content in the leaves of moringa oleifera is also really high but i don ’ t know about the oxalate content . bottom line : if it ’ s comparable in price to other healthy vegetables like broccoli i ’ d give it a try unless you ’ re pregnant or trying to get pregnant , as it has been noted to have antifertility and abortifacient properties . is there any new information on moringa oleifera ? seem s to be the new miracle plant ! yes there is . i use moringa as my only suppliment to real raw fruits and vegis . if you want to see a discovery channel video clip of the moringa plant you can check out my wesite. ryanfalls.myzijastory.com ∆ eric plott talk about it http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23509212looks like it was an animal model , which doesn ’ t translate well into human populations . i do know other research on this tree if interested ? thanks for the post maryanne ! would love to read new / other research on moringa from nf ! thnxhey justin , i have some info on it , kinda a lot bear with me.there is an interesting video with clips from researcher dr. jed fahey from johns hopkins about moringa treemoringa is often referenced as the “ miracle ” tree because it ’ s known to grow extremely well , withstand erratic weather conditions , and produce leaves that contain many nutrients that children lack around the world . the research so far shows that the leaves are safe to consume and are rich in a variety of nutrients ( i.e. iron , vitamin c , calcium , zinc ) . though the tree is widely used throughout the world , there unfortunately has not been a lot of human studies done looking at the health benefits of the leaves and any potential components that may inhibit absorption of key micronutrients ( i.e. phytic acid and oxalates ) ( see : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3290775 / ) . since it is safe and there are reported benefits to using it , it definitely won ’ t hurt to try it ! in fact worldwide it could be life saving . a student presented data on the use of the moringa tree for improving iron status in ugandan children at the university of minnesota school of public health research day , winning an award of excellence ( will post link journal link when available ) . perhaps the recognition of this research may be important for further research so that better methods for utilizing this plant are established with childhood malnutrition concerns in mind ? i think the thing about moringa is not that it is some “ superfood ” , but that it grows like a weed essentially and you can use so many parts of the plant , unlike other leafy greens.the problem is i cannot find it here in the u.s. where i live and and pills and powders are no where near the same as the fresh plant . i would not suggest supplementing it . hope that helps ! best , josephwe planted these trees in our villages in subsaharan africa when i was working with the peace corps . i added moringa powder ( pounded from dried leaves ) to my oatmeal . my neighbors made a “ tea ” from the powder as you would prepare matcha by whisking until you have a foam ( though it is obviously totally different nutritionally and tastes nothing like matcha ) .i have found moringa powder at whole foods and lazy acres here in long beach , california now that i am back home and i use it in my morning green smoothie.there is a grove in sherman oaks , california where you can purchase moringa products and even a tree for yourself ! - - -
405	is raw milk healthy ? what about raw milk ? i know the general arguments against milk as ‘ toxin ’ cites above , personally i am a vegan , but what is the actual research on raw milk vs pasteurized milk . i work in the area of local food and farmers markets and i am exposed to vegetarians and omnivores that are big boosters for raw milk . with so much propaganda and misinformation being flung from both the sides of the raw vs. pasteurized milk its hard to make sense of it all . what does the research say ? i find it hard to believe that raw milk is the super food a lot of people claim it is . image credit : usdagov / flickr wking / originally posted below hormones in skim vs. whole milk there was a systematic review published in november that looked at some of the claims of raw milk advocates . the researchers basically concluded that the impact of pasteurization on the nutritive value of milk appears to be minimal . the greater issue is that of infectious disease ( the reason it ’ s illegal in most states ) . advocates argue that consuming raw milk is a matter of personal choice , but not when they go on to infect others . for example , in a raw milk outbreak of e.coli o157 : h7 that hospitalized a number of children in connecticut , in one household a kid who consumed raw milk infected a sibling who didn ’ t , who then infected a third . for those who are interested there are a number of recent commentaries on the dangers ( here and here for example ) . before pasteurization and the virtual elimination of bovine tuberculosis , hundreds of thousands of americans died as a result of tb-infected milk . let ’ s not go back to that era . i have seen your videos on the many negative health impacts of cow ’ s milk . what is the effect of goat ’ s milk on the human system ? not alot of studies on goat milk not surprising since not as commonly consumed as cow ’ s milk . it ’ s composition is very similar to cow ’ s milk . there are many health organizations that recommend against feeding to infants for a number of reasons . given all that i would imagine it has all the adverse effects of cheese made from cow ’ s milk.thanks ! that was my comment that i posted last spring ( i think ) im so glad to see this ! my research indicates that there is far more problems associated with homogenization that pasteurization . just to be clear i do not recommend any type of bovid teat sucretionsi ’ m curious to know how to fold in the claims made by those milking a cow on a homestead scale , where the cow receives optimal grass / forage nutrition and care in handling . wondering if the disease risks lessen significantly enough to assess meticulously raised grass-fed raw milk differently . these are often the comeback arguments by those advocating raw milk , along with claims that there are benefits to the soil and farm ecosystem that grazing animals can offer.my coop just started carrying glass bottles of raw almond milk . i prefer glass to plastic bottles or plastic lined cartons , but is contamination is big concern when the milk is not from cows ? i grew up in a large rural family . we had our own farm animals and thus consumed raw milk , as did my parents before me . when i had children , i went out of my way to find raw milk , draining it out of a large milk vat into my containers , from a farm whose animals were regularly tested and results were posted . to get around the law , the farmer did not sell it to me . by inquiring and word of mouth , i found the location , left my donation on a shelf and in a sense was pilfering the milk , at my own risk.i did it for 3 reasons : first , i had read a report of the prevalence of young men having heart attacks in their 30 ’ s , following the provision of the advanced school lunch program that provided such treated milk to all children . this was a critical factor to me , as i had 3 little sons at the time ( early 60 ’ s ) .second , pasteurization kills bacteria natural to milk , which one might only guess might just be essential to human consumption and digestion of milk , after so many moons of mankind ’ s milk digestion , prior to the decision to increase the ‘ shelf life ’ of raw cow milk , as well as kill ‘ unsavory bacteria ’ for whenever the milk inspection might not be adequate.third , homogenization destroys the size of the cream particle , so that it cannot float to the top , which change also interferes with human ’ s ability to digest and assimilate the tiny particles that are now undefinable in whole milk.i remain surprised that there have been no major challenges to so called improvement in so large an area of our food supply . are there connections to certain illnesses ? heart attack in young men ? allergies ? plaque in veins and glands ? etc . has commercialism again been the primary benefactor , after all … .while the public has been sold on an inferior product , while made to believe it is superior to nature ? the same approving agencies are responsible for the current soy travesty … which is shocking ! i refer you to : the truth about soy – food revolution network blog , as well as : dr bruce fife , the coconut oil miracle.milk is only digestable by babies . after say the fourth year milk digestibility goes down . that a large part of the northern european population is not lactose intollerant does not mean milk is healthy . it just means they can tollerate it.milk is unhealthy for various reasons . i understand you have been brought up with the idea that it ’ s healthy and it will take more than a few good speeches to convince you of that fact . but you are at the right place . search for “ milk ” in the search bar and you ’ ll find a lot of relevant videos which present the information of various scientific studies in a clear format.best of luck.i think the real difference between raw and pasteurized milk is highlighted when you leave them around long enough for the curds to separate from the whey . the pasteurized version goes putrid while the raw version never does , even after weeks or even months . it simply evolves into a soft cheese , a bit like cottage cheese , and protein-rich whey , each of which is both delicious and highly nutritious . from a local farmer , we buy raw milk from grass-fed cows to deliberately create these products . i haven ’ t bought pasteurized milk for over ten years and never will again . - - -
408	what about the interheart study on heart attack risk factors ? this study might also be of interest to you and your other readers : http : / / www.ama-med.org.ar / obesidad / interheart-lancet-2004.pdf. as always , your comments and insights would be most welcome. patmcneill / originally posted on heart attacks and cholesterol : purely a question of diet thank you pat ! the lancet is one of my favorite journals . sponsored by the world health organization , the interheart study you point out was indeed a monumental undertaking , trying to tease out modifiable risk factors for heart attacks across populations in more than 50 countries on every inhabited continent . they concluded that more than 90 % of the risk of our # 1 killer is attributed to things we can do something about , like eating fruits and vegetables every day . the most important risk factor by far was cholesterol – twice as important as exercise – followed by smoking . the designated discussant at the european society of cardiology congress , where the results were first reported , lamented “ mankind is doing a good job of killing himself . ” their follow-up study , called interstroke , published in 2010 concluded that 90 % of strokes were preventable as well . i talk about preventing strokes in my 2012 summary presentation uprooting the leading causes of death . for more on more on preventing heart attacks see , for example : hi dr greger , can you please clarify this post ? i have read several articles saying the interheart study is strangely silent on the topic of saturated fats and ldl – one from the bmj here : http : / / www.bmj.com / rapid-response / 2011 / 10 / 30 / missing-figures-interheart-studythey certainly seem ambiguous in the summary , referring to ‘ abnormal lipids ’ , but the full text is not accessible.cholesterol is such an important topic , because on the one hand it has been used by statin manufacturers as the evil scapegoat , and on the other hand it is essential for many bodily functions . it is also one of the pivotal nutrients between vegans and meat eaters.i saw the same misinterpretation following the framingham study . then there is the confusion between the good and the bad – hdl and ldl.any chance of a video series clearing up this mess once and for all ? many thanks , joe - - -

410	can indian gooseberries ( amla ) be cooked without losing the health benefits ? i got volume 7 yesterday and plugged it in . great stuff . do you know if amla be used in baked goods without sacrificing the health benefits ? thanks so much for your efforts ! cherie perkins / originally posted on latest in nutrition vol . 7 dvd now available ( proceeds to charity ) ooh , great question ! indian gooseberries ( phyllanthus emblica , or “ amla ” ) are so astringent ( and sour and bitter and fibrous and overall nasty-tasting ) that they are typically processed in some way ( dried , pickled , or made into jam ) . so one would expect to find lots of good data on the effects of cooking , but i could find only one single paper . and all they looked at was the decline in vitamin c levels ( amla is one of the most concentrated sources – nearly 1 % of their weight ) . after boiling for an hour a 27 % drop in vitamin c was noted . as per all the other antioxidant phytonutrients , we simply don ’ t know . as i detailed in my video best cooking method , the nutrition of some fruits and vegetables declines with cooking , others remain just as healthful , and a few actually become healthier . the way my family gets amla into our diet is adding it to our pink juice with green foam or putting it into our a better breakfast smoothies. which herb or fruit ( besides blueberry ) can be added to a smoothie for a stressful ap student that need some boost in her systemspecific ayurvedic herbs for “ stress ” would be gotu kola , bacopa , and jatamamsi.sir ayurveda does not work like that one medicine is not prescribed to everybody with similar symptoms . for normal day to day stress i would suggest a high quality multi mineral tablet and 3-4 cups of organic green tea … if its something serious it would be better to consult an ayurvedic doctor ( in india we have 5 year degree courses in ayurveda which are recognized by the govt. of india ) , in america a certified ayurvedic doctor is difficult to find but please dont go to an ayurvedic practitioner , these people have second hand knowledge about ayurveda and that too is very limited . you can however visit a good herbalist , or tcm center.i like the taste of amla . i just eat it raw : ) ( probably because i ’ m indian ) hahataking a tea spoon of dried amla powder with luke warm water at 5.0 am on empty stomach is good for health.i put a tbs of amla powder in my post workout shake with raw cocoa powder , flax powder and a banana … cant even taste the amla . = ) is there a reputable producer / brand of amla without the heavy metals ? i ’ m a little concerned about this issue and unimpressed by the purposeful inclusion of mercury etc. regardless of ayurvedic tradition . what gives ? if any mercury is too much per the dr. , whom i have a great deal of respect for , then there surely there must be a reliable source for a dietary addition which comes so highly recommended ! its plain ignorant to believe indian manufactures purposely add mercury to amla … .i agree makardhwaj ( a compound containing mercury ) is used in certain cases in ayurvedic medicine but nobody adds makardhwaj to plain amla powder.hi all ! i thought that gooseberries are bitter too until i saw this video ( below ) . although they could come on different varieties . stay healthy.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = n40hlfecaj8a search on wikipedia for ‘ indian gooseberry ’ is redirected to phyllanthus emblica http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / indian _ gooseberry.at the top of this article is a link for ‘ list of plants known as gooseberry ’ http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / list _ of _ plants _ known _ as _ gooseberry , headed by the statement “ gooseberry most often refers to cultivated plants from two species of the genus ribes : … ” ( listing 27 species ) . this latter article then goes on to list plants [ called gooseberry ] unrelated to ribes , citing seven families.the genus ribes http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / ribes “ includes the edible currants ( blackcurrant , redcurrant , white currant ) , gooseberry , and several hybrid varieties.so , indian gooseberry is from a different genus than the many other plants called gooseberry , not just a different species / variety.in the phyllanthus emblica / indian gooseberry article is this description , “ the taste of indian gooseberry is sour , bitter and astringent , and it is quite fibrous . in india , it is common to eat gooseberries steeped in salt water and turmeric to make the sour fruits palatable [ citation needed ] . it is also used to straighten hair . : - ) is amla safe to consume for nursing mothers and breastfeeding infants ? - - -
411	how can i preserve the anti-cancer effects of cooked garlic ? awesome video , dr. greger ! i am left with the question of the anticancer effects of raw vs. cooked garlic and onions . i know cooking reduces some of the nutrients but have raw and cooked alliums been tested in regard to the anti-cancer effects ? in other words is it important to try to consume these raw notwithstanding their very strong flavors ? michelle rowe / originally posted on # 1 anticancer vegetable the secret to maintaining the anti-cancer effects of garlic is to either eat it raw ( think salsa , homemade dressings , pesto , etc ) or crush the garlic first , wait 10 minutes , and then cook it . you know those chemical flares ? you bend them , two chemicals mix and a light-emitting reaction takes place ? the same kind of thing happens in garlic . floating around in the cytoplasm of garlic cells is a compound called alliin and packed away in tiny intracellular storage compartments ( called vacuoles ) is an enzyme called alliinase . when the garlic tissues are crushed , the two mix and alliinase turns alliin into allicin , the phytonutrient thought to be responsible for many of garlic ’ s health benefits . cooking destroys the enzyme , though , so even if you crush your garlic , if it ’ s thrown immediately into the pan , little allicin may be produced . allicin is relatively heat stable , though , so if you chop your garlic and wait 10 minutes for the allicin to be formed , you can then cook it ( the enzyme has already done its work ) and presumably maintain many of the benefits . a similar reaction happens in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli ! check out my videos the best detox and sometimes the enzyme myth is true . what do you think of this , is it true ? wow- very interesting … .everyone should read : ) onions ! i had never heard this ! ! ! please read to the end : importantin 1919 when the flu killed 40 million people there was this doctor that visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu … many of the farmers and their families had contracted it and many died.the doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise , everyone was very healthy . when the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home , ( probably only two rooms back then ) . the doctor couldn ’ t believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and place it under the microscope . she gave him one and when he did this , he did find the flu virus in the onion . it obviously absorbed the bacteria , therefore , keeping the family healthy.now , i heard this story from my hairdresser . she said that several years ago , many of her employees were coming down with the flu , and so were many of her customers . the next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop . to her surprise , none of her staff got sick . it must work . try it and see what happens . we did it last year and we never got the flu.now there is a p. s. to this for i sent it to a friend in oregon who regularly contributes material to me on health issues . she replied with this most interesting experience about onions : thanks for the reminder . i don ’ t know about the farmer ’ s story … but , i do know that i contacted pneumonia , and , needless to say , i was very ill … i came across an article that said to cut both ends off an onion put it into an empty jar , and place the jar next to the sick patient at night . it said the onion would be black in the morning from the germs … sure enough it happened just like that … the onion was a mess and i began to feel better.another thing i read in the article was that onions and garlic placed around the room saved many from the black plague years ago . they have powerful antibacterial , antiseptic properties.this is the other note . lots of times when we have stomach problems we don ’ t know what to blame . maybe it ’ s the onions that are to blame . onions absorb bacteria is the reason they are so good at preventing us from getting colds and flu and is the very reason we shouldn ’ t eat an onion that has been sitting for a time after it has been cut open.left over onions are poisonousi had the wonderful privilege of touring mullins food products , makers of mayonnaise . questions about food poisoning came up , and i wanted to share what i learned from a chemist.ed , who was our tour guide , is a food chemistry whiz . during the tour , someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise . people are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil . ed ’ s answer will surprise you . ed said that all commercially-made mayo is completely safe . “ it doesn ’ t even have to be refrigerated . no harm in refrigerating it , but it ’ s not really necessary . ” he explained that the ph in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment . he then talked about the summer picnic , with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table , and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.ed says that , when food poisoning is reported , the first thing the officials look for is when the ‘ victim ’ last ate onions and where those onions came from ( in the potato salad ? ) . ed says it ’ s not the mayonnaise ( as long as it ’ s not homemade mayo ) that spoils in the outdoors . it ’ s probably the onions , and if not the onions , it ’ s the potatoes.he explained onions are a huge magnet for bacteria , especially uncooked onions . you should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion .. he says it ’ s not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.it ’ s already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit , that it can be a danger to you ( and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park ! ) . ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you ’ ll probably be okay , but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich , you ’ re asking for trouble . both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad , will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.also , dogs should never eat onions . their stomachs cannot metabolize onions.please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to use it to cook the next day , it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.this is purely a myth.i ’ d love to hear what dr greger thinks about alisa wiegel ’ s post too ! is any of that true . i ’ ve always been a big fan of raw onions and eat them daily so i store a large red onion sliced in half and then cut from it for daily salads and sandwiches . is there harm in this approach ? there are plenty of articles online that refute these cut onion claims , such as http : / / www.snopes.com / food / tainted / cutonions.aspso does garlic powder have the same benefits ? what about those bottles at most grocery stores of garlic already chopped & marinating in it ’ s own juices ; that should be full of allicin , correct ? similarly , with onions , it appears you have to cut them and then wait about 30 minutes for the enzyme to do its work. http : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2013 / 04 / 20 / anti-cancer-recipes-should-you-cook-onions / seeing the virus in the onion with a 1919 microscope is a big , big hoax ! just read more about viruses , how big they are , and how are they isolated and tested . flu virus could not be “ seen ” in 1919 . flu virus could be tested by inoculating fertile chicken eggs.hi dr. greger , do powdered or granulated alliums have any dietary benefit other than flavor ?

412	given the “ brain-eating amoeba ” ( naegleria fowleri ) in tap water should i sterilize my neti pot water ? dr greger- i love your informative videos . thanks so much . i have not missed a day of nosewashing since 1995 . i rinse out my neti pots and have never had any trouble but perhaps i should clean them in the dishwasher ? i read an article about 2 deaths linked to a “ brain-eating amoeba ” called naegleria fowleri in tap water used in a neti pot in the south . the article says that that amoeba is rare and usually found in the warm fresh water lakes and rivers of the south – florida and louisana & around there . i ’ m in california – should i now boil my nosewashing water & let it cool ? shellbelle / originally posted on the risks and benefits of neti pot nasal irrigation i do recommend you effectively sterilize your neti pots using one of the two methods i describe in my risks and benefits of neti pot nasal irrigation video . in terms of naegleria fowleri , it ’ s not really an amoeba but it does appear to eat brains . it apparently invades through the lining of the nose and climbs along the olfactory nerve fibers into the brain , causing a nearly invariably fatal meningoencephalitis ( about 99 % of reported victims die ) . thankfully it ’ s extremely rare ( only about 3 cases a year reported in united states ) . it is a thermophilic ( warmth loving ) organism , and indeed most cases are reported in the south , but there was a case up in minnesota last year , so i agree with the new safety advisory that one should use only distilled or previously boiled ( and cooled ) water to irrigate one ’ s nose . bottled water isn ’ t recommended since it may be even more biologically contaminated ( see my video bottled water vs. tap ) . if it isn ’ t an amoeba , then what is it ? it ’ s a protist. http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / protistif i rinse my netipot with boiling water before i use it , is plastic okay or should i get a ceramic one ? so much plastic these days has bpa which isn t a good thing . ceramic or glass would be preferable … stay away from products made in china tho.i am new to this site. i am looking for nutrition for parkinsonismis - - -
413	does adding baking soda to soaking beans reduce gas ? i recently heard that the reason humans produce gas after eating beans is because they contain raffinose which is a starch that is poorly digested due to a lack of the enzyme galactosidase . the md claimed that adding baking soda to the soaking liquid reduced the raffinose . have you heard anything about this ? vegan epicurean / originally posted on beans and gas : clearing the air yes indeed , research dating back more than 25 years ( “ effect of processing on flatus-producing factors in legumes “ ) found that adding baking soda to the soak water of dried beans before cooking ( about 1 / 16 teaspoon per quart ) significantly decreases the content of the raffinose family of sugars . the study i profile here in beans and gas : clearing the air that concluded “ people ’ s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be exaggerated ” used canned beans , though , which i find to be much more convenient . if you have the time , though , it ’ s hard to imagine a better nutritional bargain than dried beans , peas , and lentils . for more on the most nutrition you can squeeze out of a dollar see : image credit : grongar / flickr recently my friend gave me a jar of asafoetida . using a very small sprinkling when soaking the beans apparently reduces the flatulence effect of the beans . the local indian store may have it labeled as hing.wikipedia states this : asafoetida reduces the growth of indigenous microflora in the gut , reducing flatulence . ^ s. k. garg , a. c. banerjea , j. verma and m. j. abraham , “ effect of various treatments of pulses on in vitro gas production by selected intestinal clostridia ” . journal of food science , volume 45 , issue 6 ( p . 1601 – 1602 ) .there is one catch , this herb is also called devils dung for a good reason . it stinks ! hoo man , it stinks . however , using a very small sprinkling and cooking the herb reduces the smell and changes it a bit . i found my self salivating when cooking the beans.i made up a big batch of humus and it tasted great . no hint of the devils dung in the flavor , and i must say i ’ m not as gassy from eating the humus.i love the smell of asafoetida , just be careful not to use too much or it does start to taste nastyi found long ago that taking one pantothenic acid vitamins with vitamin b and c-complex also removed gas from various sources , including beans . what also works at reducing flatulence is soaking the beans over night and then cooking them in a slow cooker all day for the next meal.but , i ’ ll also store the baking soda idea in my brain . thanks.soak and cook beans in ginger . takes the farts right out.for those using canned beans , get a pressure cooker . makes cooking beans sooo much quicker ! what ph is best for the soaking solution ? ( i have caustic soda , i suppose a very small quantity will do the job ) i ’ ve read that the lectin content in beans and other legumes makes all people intolerant to these foods and that they are inflammatory to the gut . is this true ? lectin and other antinutrients found in beans are eliminated with cooking . most people consume cooked beans so this is a non issue.i would be interested to hear dr. greger ’ s opinion on the theory that the lectins in beans / legumes build up in the system and are what is behind the pain and discomfort that some people ( including me ) have experienced when eating them on a weekly ( or even daily ) basis.what are your thoughts about using the product beano ? thank you for the informantion ! i find canned beans to be more gas producing than my own pressure cooked ones . if you soak them 8-12 hours in water , drain and rinse well , then keep them in covered container so they don ’ t dry out and rinse twice a day until they grow little tails ( about same length as the original bean is good ) ( couple days depending on bean and temperature ) much less gas , much easier to digest , less calories , more nutrients.okay here is my secret for reduced-gas beans . i soak them in distilled water for 24 hours and then let them drain , covered with a towel in a colander for 2 days , rinsing them in clean water twice a day . after three days of being damp , the beans should be sprouting anywhere from 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 inch . something about sprouting the beans before cooking them seems to reduce the amount of gas they create after you eat them . not all distilled waters are created equal . i have found ozarka distilled water more effective than grocery store brand distilled water . could be the distilling process that makes a difference ? i have just been told that i should absolutely soak my grains , beans , nuts and seeds before cooking and eating them because of the phytic acid issue ( and frantic googling has not helped me figuring out if this is a myth or an exaggeration or what ) . can you please tell me if i should soak those things ? if yes , for how long ? some sites say 24-48 hours ? as a vegan , i eat a lot of those things daily . thank you very much for your help and your great website ! anna : based on dr. greger ’ s videos and just plain common sense ( mine i guess ) , i don ’ t think it is necessary to soak before cooking . for one thing , cooking gets rid of the majority of the phytic acid . and for another thing , phytic acid may be very good for you . check this out : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = phytateshope that helps.i ’ ve spent several decades of cooking and eating many kinds of beans . my method for lessening the gas-producing properties of the beans was to always add 1 tsp. baking soda to the cooking water ( after soaking and pouring off the soaking water and rinsing with cold water ) . to prevent the taste of the soda , i also added 1 tab. granulated sugar . i always preferred to use a 6-quart heavy cast iron dutch oven and cooked on the stove top . i never liked pressure cooked beans or slow cooked beans.seeingeye : dr. greger has an “ ask the doctor ” page on the idea of adding baking soda to soaking beans : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / does-adding-baking-soda-to-soaking-beans-reduce-raffinose / your idea of adding sugar is a twist i hadn ’ t heard before . very interesting . thanks for sharing.i always used canned beans because of the convenience factor until i discovered how freakin ’ easy it is to cook them from dried in a slow cooker . you don ’ t need to pre-soak them , there ’ s no worrying about the stove being on or anything burning etc . you just load up the slow cooker and leave it alone like a rice cooker ( another godsend ) . and i find the beans actually taste better , have a better texture and make me feel healthier . personally , i don ’ t get gas from beans but i ’ ve been eating them forever . anyways in the slow cooker i do include a little piece of ginger , so maybe that ’ s been helping as people have shared – though i only add it to enhance the flavor of the beans ( along with a bay leaf , a halved onion and a whole garlic clove per 1 dried cup with 3 cups of water ) .i in no way sell or profit from slow cookers , i ’ m just so so happy that i discovered mine after 20 years of being a vegetarian ( and always too lazy to cook beans from scratch ) ! i eat one cup ( dried ) yielding 4 cups wet of a variety of beans per day with no gas . i wonder what my microbiome has than accomplishes the task ? - - -
414	how much fruit is safe to consume ? thank you for this fantastic , resourceful website . i ’ m a bit confused on how much fruit is safe to consume . the study you quote here says it ’ s healthy but there are other well known doctors who say one should not consume more than 2 – 3 fruits per day . apparently it can harm our liver and raise triglycerides ? thanks for clarifying. dave23 / originally posted on are dates good for you ? answer the only thing i can imagine they ’ re thinking about is the relationship between rising fructose consumption and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , but the fructose is coming from high fructose corn syrup ( mostly from soft drinks ) and table sugar , not fruit . see for example this recent article . fruit may even have beneficial effects , for example this study on prunes and liver function . as far as i can tell , the best available science says that the more fruit the better . the more we study them the more cool things fruit appear able to do ! here ’ s a few examples : thanks for making me laugh dr. greger while you teach me something too ! ! scottyo-aspen.i always feel dizzy and funny after having lots of fruit . my teeth feel sensitive too , i prefer starch and salads . would that advice apply to me too ? why do i feel so crappy after having lots of fruit example : smoothie of berries , strawberry , banana , orange , mango , papaya ? i would say improper food combining could cause that maybe ? fruit is best on an empty stomach because it is fast digesting.just my opinion . i eat a ton of fruit , it always makes me feel awesome , i start off morning and lunch large portions , and keep salads and fats for the evening.try asking dr . morsend or search archive on rawfigs.com. i have similar problems that you describe . it appears to be an effect of low functioning adrenals which are responsible for proper sodium / potassium balance . they secret a hormone wich helps reabsorb sodium . another typical effect is craving salt . with boosting their function this effect apparently goes away . i , myself , am still waiting to recive “ a booster package ” . if you ’ re interesting i can share the results.i have the same problem with fruit ; now i have been cutting out the fat ( = a handfull of nuts / seeds per day ) and i feel better ( doing raw till 4 ) but now i have a ( slightly ) white and swollen tongue ( morning ) – i do have a bit of honey in my tea ( 5x / day ) – could that be the issue ? now i am going to try every diet for 2 weeks : raw till 4 – mc dougall – 80 / 10 / 10 and raw food ( low carb-high fat ) i hope that will give me an answer after 4 years of high raw ( low fat ) … … i would like your opion : -d you can contact me at ilsemaes @ hotmail.com if you know the answer … ( subject = raw food ) thanks ! have sent you an email . the key to regeneration is detoxification of old sins ( hardened mucus with old waste , hardened protein obsticales in lymph , any parasites ) . the most effiecient way is fasting . i hope dr. greger will have more videos on fasting in the future.but adrenals are not the only organ that can be damaged with modern diets . all endocrine glands and organs must work properly to have good digestion , absorption and utilization . ofcourse after that good elimination is desired . it is possible to repair the system with herbs , greens , medicinal mushrooms , in extreme cases with glandulars and later with fruit.unfortunately , if you are having problems with digestive system , fruit can cause some painful symptoms . so it is better to move on slowly.i use myfitnesspal and i always manage to get around 60g over what they recommend for sugar intake . i always land within other nutritional targets with ease , but always go waaay beyond the recommended sugar intake . today the suagr came from a green apple , beets , mango , and sweet potato ( with a few here and there from barley , spinach etc ) i usually wouldn ’ t care much , but 60g seems like a lot to be overshooting . is this ok ? ? is 115g of sugar a day actually alright if it ’ s coming from whole food sources ? yes.the video if fructose is bad , what about fruit ? is helpful because it talks about the difference between the sugars we get from fruit vs. added sugars.i know that fruit is good for you , but would it be unhealthy to get all your carbohydrates from fruit rather than consuming a mix of fruit ( simple carbohydrates ) and starch ( complex carbohydrates ) ? some doctors seem to suggest that too much fruit can raise triglycerides , or that we should be relying on low glycemic index starchy foods for our carbohydrates , while there are also some raw food experts that suggest that fruit is our best carbohydrate source . with all the conflicting information out there it can be hard to figure out what is best . i would really appreciate your input ! sarah : here is a blog post showing dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . you can see that he recommends eating a variety of foods : not just fruit and not just starch. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.i work as a registered dietitian and many of my clients consume a ton of fruit , but i always remind them that adding variety is key to a balanced diet . complex carbohydrates often offer more fiber and b vitamins , as well as a number of micronutrients . i would continue to eat fruit , but make an effort to make half your grains whole . a little after 2 minutes into this video it addresses refined grain versus whole grain consumption and its pretty interesting ! http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / calculate-your-healthy-eating-score / it really depends if youre consuming the whole fruit or say fruit juice which is worse as it releases sugar a lot faster. theres a big difference between sugar in fruit and also grains [ eg corn causes fatty liver cf foie gras so america is in trouble ] . some people eg those with coeliac disease like myself don ’ t digest disaccharide sugars and others like those present in potatoes very well due to damaged enterocytes from autoimmune gluten damage and so the simple sugars in fruit are easier to processes . but fruit has lots of acid and i got worse dental health eating loads of fruit and also for me i developed gluten intolerance and it got a lot worse after eating a high fruit diet [ fruitarian ] as the root cause is candida . when you consume sugar on its own and not with fat or protein it gets released very fast into bloodstream . agave and other high fructose sources should be avoided , and you need greens as well if you are eating mostly fruit for the other nutrients and a good source of fat to prevent bile flow problems. eg avocados oil or eggswhat are your thoughts ( or that of others posting ) as to eating 10 banana smoothies with 100g of coconut sugar for breakfast followed by a 250g medjool date smoothie for lunch ? i was having this almost everyday for a year.so , i was looking for an answer for the following question : is fructose dangerous for diabetics ? or even more cruel , is high fructose consumption causing diabetes ? i went to an 801010 livestyle . i am 801010er since almost 6 weeks now an i am a high grade diabetic , wich means , i use to inject insulin 4 times a day in high doses ( 20 – 30 insulin units per injection ) and 2000 mg of metformin / day . i use to eat 10 to 15 bananas and other fruits ( like nectarins , berries ) a day and in the evening i eat cooked meals like rice , potatoes , veggies and such things . my hba1c has reduced from 11.2 to 8.4 since i started 801010 . but i am a little concerned how fructose has to do with all that . everywhere i read “ fructose for diabetics are dangerous ” . i know that fructose do not need any insulin to be processed . but the blood sugar goes up any way . so what is the truth ? videohoersaal : i ’ m not a doctor and can ’ t comment specifically on your situation . however , i hope this helps : with these questions , i highly recommend that you read the book , “ dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes ” . that program is clinically proven to be 3 times more effective that other diets . and that information is 100 % in line with the information found on nutritionfacts . when you read the book , you will learn what really causes diabetes and what to do about it to prevent diabetes or manage and most likely reverse it if you have it . it even has recipes at the end . ( spoiler alert : some of the recipes include fruit , but not all or most of them . ) here ’ s the book if you are interested : http : / / www.amazon.com / neal-barnards-program-reversing-diabetes / dp / 1594868107 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 ? ie = utf8 & qid = 1408044882 & sr = 8-1 & keywords = barnard + prevent + or + reverse + diabetesdr . greger , what are your thoughts on the 80 / 10 / 10 diet invented by douglas graham ? i would like to know the same thing … … you can contact me at ilsemaes @ hotmail.com if you know the answer … thanks ! - - -
416	are gmos safe and are the nutrients in our crops declining ? please discuss gmos and decreased nutrition in our foods . mary ellen / originally posted on nutrition education in medicine : a doctor a day keeps the apples away for a discussion on how much the nutrient content of food crops has declined over the last 50 years please see my video crop nutrient decline . in terms of gmos , i ’ ve published a few papers on the inclusion of genetically modified animals in the food supply ( for example here , here , and here ) , but the relative risks and benefits of genetic engineering in crop agriculture is less clear . unfortunately , the latest review on the safety of plant gmos is not freely available , but an earlier review is . if one is interested in the two extremes of the debate i ’ d suggest health risks of genetically modified foods on the “ anti ” side and why genetically modified crops ? on the pro . what are your thoughts on the monsanto bill that was just passed ? ? ? we ’ ve just begun to understand the real power of food ( fruits and vegetables ) and monsanto tries already to “ enhance ” it … i think it ’ s like to play with fire … there are too many bias with gmo … we ’ ve been “ playing ” with it for thousands of years . as long as we keep to cisgenic gm crops for now ; there should be no more health risks than from conventional crop production , as has been demonstrated to be the case for over 25 years by hundreds of independent research teams.http : / / informahealthcare.com / doi / abs / 10.3109 / 07388551.2013.823595 http : / / www.aaas.org / sites /

deeply oppose for several reasons.by gl woolsey september 13 , 2012 source articlegmo foods are such an embedded part of our food system these days , but it ’ s not difficult to think back to a time when food was simpler and healthier . how did we get to the point that genetically modified organisms infiltrate so much of what we eat ? gmo expert gl woolsey took a look at the history of gmos . we present that for you here now.1935 – dna discoveredrussian scientist andrei nikolaevitch belozersky isolates pure dna.1973 – recombinant dna createdthe idea for man-made dna , or rdna , comes from a grad student at stanford university medical school . professor herbert boyer and a few of his biologist colleagues run with it.1975 – asilomar conferencea group of biologists get together with a few lawyers and doctors to create guidelines for the safe use of genetically engineered dna.1980 – first gmo patent issueda 1980 court case between a genetics engineer at general electric and the u.s. patent office is settled by a 5-to-4 supreme court ruling , allowing for the first patent on a living organism . the gmo in question is a bacterium with an appetite for crude oil , ready to gobble up spills.1982 – fda approves first gmohumulin , insulin produced by genetically engineered e. coli bacteria , appears on the market.1994 – gmo hits grocery storesthe u.s. food and drug administration approves the flavr savr tomato for sale on grocery store shelves . the delayed-ripening tomato has a longer shelf life than conventional tomatoes.1996 – gmo-resistant weedsweeds resistant to glyphosate , the herbicide used with many gmo crops , are detected in australia . research shows that the super weeds are seven to 11 times more resistant to glyphosate than the standard susceptible population.1997 – mandatory labelsthe european union rules in favor of mandatory labeling on all gmo food products , including animal feed.1999 – gmo food crops dominateover 100 million acres worldwide are planted with genetically engineered seeds . the marketplace begins embracing gmo technology at an alarming rate.2003 – gmo-resistant pestsin 2003 , a bt-toxin-resistant caterpillar-cum-moth , helicoverpa zea , is found feasting on gmo bt cotton crops in the southern united states . in less than a decade , the bugs have adapted to the genetically engineered toxin produced by the modified plants.2011 – bt toxin in humansresearch in eastern quebec finds bt toxins in the blood of pregnant women and shows evidence that the toxin is passed to fetuses.2012 – farmer wins court battlefrench farmer paul francois sues monsanto for chemical poisoning he claims was caused by its pesticide lasso , part of the roundup ready lineof products . francois wins and sets a new precedent for future cases.2014 – gmo patent expiresmonsanto ’ s patent on the roundup ready line of genetically engineered seeds will end in two years . in 2009 , monsanto introduced roundup 2 with a new patent set to make the first-generation seed obsolete.dr. gregor : i recently ran across an interview of mit scientist stephanie seneff discuss glyphosate in our foods and it ’ s affect on gut bacteria and amino acids as a possible cause of autism . the interview can be googled using her name , glyphosate and autism . here are the slides from a talk she gave recently on this subject.http :

this excellent site . it ’ s outstanding.sandra pricethe paper actually proposes that glyphosate is cause for a whole myriad of diseases , not just autism – very interesting – some novel re cholesterol – hypotheses in this work – we need to wake up and get all genetic engineering stopped.no researcher can completely assess the potential of harm to those allergic to the protein in a genetic modification since allergies are so specific to the individual but here is a link to an article citing a good deal of research suggesting an association of the extreme rise in allergies with gmos : http : / / www.globalresearch.ca / genetically-modified-foods-unsafe-evidence-that-links-gm-foods-to-allergic-responses-mounts / 7277good point . gmo foods should be avoided as a precautionary measure . for those interested in avoiding a good resource is jeff smith ’ s website , institute for responsible technology . the film and book entitled genetic roulette do a good job giving an overview of this area . given the control of research by corporations i don ’ t anticipate any good studies in the future . i advise all my patients to avoid gmo foods . thanks for the link.transgenic gmo ’ s yes , but definitely not cisgenic as they pose no more threat than any regular crop . in fact the science does demonstrate that no gmo on the market pose any risk.the few researchers who opposed this and posted studies on it actually have had a disingenuous agenda just to oppose gmo ’ s to begin with . examples being the maize study , corn study , pigs study , tomato study , potato study , etc. and this all goes against decades of scientific research . of course all these studies have been severely debunked and it ’ s sad that anti-gmo people do not focus on the real issues at hand.http : / / theness.com / neurologicablog / index.php / seralini-gmo-study-retracted / http : / / theness.com / neurologicablog / index.php / the-gm-corn-rat-study / http : / / www.marklynas.org /

for health and environment but thanks to the anti-gmo crowd we didn ’ t see these eco-friendly solutions spring into action . people should be more concerned about monoculture in general and perhaps be more skeptic about transgenic gmos but there ’ s no reason to oppose cisgenic gm food . dr. steven novella , famous skeptic , makes valid points on this that i would like everyone to hear out : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 7tc8gtzggkohttp : / / www.cisgenesis.com / content / view / 4 / 28 / lang , englishand these are also independent research teams uninfluenced by biotech companies . so you can either respect the science or you don ’ t , but i hope you keep an open mind and take a closer look . i was also against gmo ’ s not too long ago but that was mainly caused by cultural indoctrination rather than evidence . as we can observe , the conclusion so far remains that it is no worse than what we already have and the real issue is monocultures in general.how can we avoid them if they are not labeled ? ? i eat only organic so it ’ s not me i worry about .. it ’ s my grandson , school snacks , whatever you can ’ t control ! if the preschool teacher doesn ’ t feed the kids gmos by avoiding products with that label but american ’ s don ’ t even have the right to know ! it ’ s insane .. i think mon ’ insane ’ to although not ‘ insane ’ they are very calculatingly dominating the food supply with what is probably know but are keeping quiet is toxic.there is no objective scientific reason that genetically modified foods should be harmful . if we take out the issue of pesticides , which may take advantage of the benefits of gmo but shouldn ’ t be an argument against genetic modification per se , they should theoretically be like any other plants . species are always genetically modifying themselves naturally at random , so for a scientist to go in and speed up the process , or make it more beneficial to humans , and then let the plants grow naturally without chemicals , does not make the plants less “ natural ” . of course , safety assessments should be done on such plants as they are new species and may have different levels of the compounds in them , but any food that evolves on it ’ s own would be the same . therefore , to indiscriminately oppose all genetic modification of food on the basis of health effects ( as opposed to the use of pesticides , the ethical standings of the companies that produce them , effects on the environment , etc ) is ridiculous and may be detrimental to all the amazing advancements that could come out of this research.i am still waiting for the science as well . i feel the gmo scare is a bit overblown.how can you take out the issue of herbicides & pesticides when 90 + % of the gmo crops are made to be sprayed with glyphosate ? i agree that genetic engineering of plants needs safety studies but relying on the companies to do them is foolhardy at best . they have a blatant conflict of interest . 3 month studies on rats that live 2 years is 21 months too little.i think the current approach is nonsense as it randomly changes proteins which your body then sees as foreign . the much better approach is that of companies like kaiima bio-agritech . natural but accelerated selection . that doesn ’ t change the dna or the proteins but still gives you much larger yields.please don ’ t reference pseudoscience . here ’ s a list of commonly referenced anti-gm ( the rat study among them ) studies that most people cite despite lack of peer review or the pseudoscientific label : http : / /

house ( in this case elsevier ) owns the article and can charge for access to it . in fact , if you publish an article while you ’ re in grad school , and later want to include that material in your dissertation , you have to ask the publisher for permission , since you don ’ t own it anymore , they do . there is a push towards open access publishing , but unfortunately it is harder on the individual researcher financially , and there is also the issue of the “ impact factor ” associated with already existing journals . to opt to publish in the newer open access journals , a researcher loses the status and impact factor associated with the traditional journals . hopefully the situation will improve in the future ; personally i find it abominable that publicly funded research is not available to the public.so , while you don ’ t have access to this article on your own , you may try a local university library , particularly a research-oriented one , and if that library has a subscription to that particular journal ( these can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars per year ) , then you will be able to access it on the library computers freely.i can access this particular review at my work , and what they say basically is that there was only enough new information to genuinely reassess three plants : maize , soybeans , and rice . among these plants , there are studies showing that they are harmful , and studies showing that they are harmless , and so the debate continues.they also make reference to this summary published by the european food safety authority , which you should have access to : http : / / www.efsa.europa.eu / en / efsajournal / pub / 1700.htmmonsanto and their allies are very aware that europeans and others who have the right to know will not willing eat or buy their crops . the way they fed the europeans gmo corn and soy was through the livestock feed shipped from brazil and argentina . the eu boycotted the same product from the usa , according to friends of earth-europe.they do not want to lose control of the u.s.a. marketplace . plus , they are growing food in the usa and through obama ’ s trade agreements forcing the entire world to eat this potentially toxic food . hence , we will all die of the same or similar diseases , and no single herbicide or gmo will be singled out.monsanto and allies have also blocked anyone from studying their seeds , they have blocked journals from publishing data , and they have appointed one of their approved scientists to the independent criigen.http : / / www.criigen.org / siteen / they ’ re just your average american corporation and there are a lot of myths surrounding them as well as they have become the icon of corporate evil . yet that is hardly the case.http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 7tc8gtzggkoseralini has been so severely debunked for not following standard procedures . as an easy wiki reference read will teach you : “ the conclusions that séralini drew from the experiments were widely criticized , as was the design of the experiments . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] scientists claimed that séralini ’ s conclusions were impossible to justify given the small sample size and the known high incidence of tumors in sprague-dawley rats . the paper was also refuted by food standards agencies . [ 5 ] other long term studies , which were publicly funded , have uncovered no health issues . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the release of the book and movie in conjunction with the scientific paper , and the requirement that journalists sign a confidentiality agreement , were also criticized and negatively peer reviewed . [ 3 ] ” http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / s % c3 % a9ralini _ affairas a lifetime environmental activist , i know what surrounds monsanto is not a myth.for more about dr. seralini , go to : http : / / www.anh-usa.org / monsanto-goes-organic-and-wins-sustainability-award-right / print / when you eat gmo foods you are eating glyphosate . that poisons you gut bacteria by the same shikimate pathway that kills plants and leads to autoimmune and inflammation based conditions.do you have any information on what if any the safe level of glyphosate is for human consumption ? how to get rid of it if when you are exposed ? thankshow could there be any safe level when it works as you yourself state ? ? that is a very valid question . along with a few others.1 ) why don ’ t they test roundup ( the finished product ) rather than just the single so called active ingredient ? 2 ) is there an additive or synergistic effect with the adjuvant chemicals used with glyphosate ? 3 ) why do they raise the allowable levels when each new generation of gmo crops get released ? 4 ) now that super weeds are resistant to glyphosate what levels of 2-4d are safe for long term consumption ? that is the next wave of gmo crops coming.how would one know which of the many ingredients in roundup may be causing the problem ? the active ingredient , glyphosate , is the only ingredient off-patent now.2,4-d , which unintentionally contains 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated diobenzo-p-dioxin ( the same chemical responsible for severe birth defects / developmental disorders in vietnam , and major chemical spills or explosions , pvc plastics , and more , is a component of the herbicide , which was sparingly approved on cereal grains , but will now be used on soy and corn that have been genetically engineered to be herbicide resistant.it ’ s a good reason to eat low on the food chain , low fat foods , and also have a whole house and at least a kitchen carbon filter water purifier.my multi-pure 750 sb ( below the sink ) will reduce both 2,4-d and dioxin from my tap water if it is in there.it has been in the past , but the city changed water sources and last testing showed it was not present . this was confirmed by tests which i also paid for . have your water tested by a reliable lab . if it contains 2,4-d , by all means , get the best water filter you can afford.but , remember . if spraying is occurring near you , as it is within 15 miles of where i live , nothing can prevent airborne emissions- drift from drifting down on my organic homegrown crops or coming down with the rain.monsanto says ge broccoli and tomatoes are coming.i buy those grown by the organic method , until i can grow my own.when you are eating gmo foods , you are eating more than glyphosate . monsanto also uses 2,4-d ( a dioxin contaminated chemical of the worst kind ) . roundup may also be contaminated with dioxin , but no one knows for certain because the testing has not been done . as someone who has been poisoned with pesticides , who has found that physicians are taught to treat the symptoms not cure a disease , let me say there are no safe levels . so much can go wrong with your health in addition to cancers … and then , there are synergistic effects . do you even know a water company that is certified by nsf to reduce glyphosate in your tap water ? or , are there any testing procedures that show glyphosate may be in your tap water ? i suggest monsanto has blocked that pathway , as well .. i would say there is no reason to oppose gmo ’ s based on the supposed health issues because there are none as any complete review of the scientific literature demonstrates : http : / / informahealthcare.com / doi / abs / 10.3109 / 07388551.2013.823595http : / / www.aaas.org / sites / default / files / migrate / uploads / aaas _ gm _ statement.pdfin fact most researchers against gmo ’ s have routinely had an agenda and misrepresented their studies for selfish gains . here ’ s some examples : http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0278691512005637http : / / www.marklynas.org / 2013 / 06 / gmo-pigs-study-more-junk-science / http : / / theness.com / neurologicablog / index.php / the-gm-corn-rat-study / http : / / theness.com / neurologicablog / index.php / seralini-gmo-study-retracted / and when it comes to monsanto they ’ re no worse than your average corporation and they have just become the icon of corporate evil . yet most of the claims about them are just outright false : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 7tc8gtzggkoas for environmental concerns , it varies greatly between climates and in some cases gm crops are better for environment and use less hectares , pesticides , etc.the problem is monoculture in general and not gm crops . although gm crops do pose solutions for this and monsanto did as well , but … ( watch the video ) http : / / environment.nationalgeographic.com / environment / global-warming / food-how-altered / “ it ’ s all just big agro conspiracy mongering that ’ s just part of an anti-gmo ideological agenda . ” i have severe osteoporosis and keep breaking bones . i have refused to take genetically engineered boniva or other recombinant dna pharms which use e-coli bacteria to make the product . look at the side effects of the bisphosonate drugs at the national library of medicine.it ’ s not only pharms that use organisms from other species , food crops use the same . i intercepted an posting by a major player in the contamination of our food that will be using a superbug — antibiotic resistant bacteria for its ge corn and soy . no wonder hospitals have so many cases of antibiotic resistant bacteria ! the environmental working group using data from the cdc and usda compiled a report of antibiotic resistant bacteria identified in livestock found in supermarkets throughout the country. http : / / www.ewg.org / meateatersguide / superbugs / when i had an infection last year , nothing my physician prescribed worked until i suggested that he use an older antibiotic because i ’ ve eaten vegan for the past 2 years , and only ate certified organic for a decade previous to that . the older drug worked . more recently , another physician who treated me for a pelvic fracture ( due to a bad fall ) . viewing the x-ray at the time of the injury , and the comparison tone done 3 weeks later , he said he had never seen anyone grow bone so fast . at the next visit , two months from the onset of the injury , he declared my bone totally healed . perhaps , it was because i only eat certified organic and only from companies i trust and now only eat healthy vegan ! when i stop healing quickly , it may be because our food is contaminated with mineral chelators – herbicides . roundup is patented as a mineral chelator , binding minerals in the soil and keeping them from being assimilated by plants and animals . i do not look forward to being forced to eat genetically engineered foods , given what has been learned about roundup from abstracts of scientific studies , and the severe clinical health effects of the process of genetic engineering itself as told go us with genetically engineered “ biological ” pharmaceuticals.eskil must work for monsanto or has another financial concern . my advice : don ’ t eat one gmo ! it isn ’ t easy . i buy only organic , eat only vegan since watching dr. greger , never ever go out to eat ( and i won ’ t until they have a gmo-free option on the menu .. not just vegan as i asked a waiter if the vegan portuguese soup was gmo free but in fact they had used canola oil — big one not to eat ) . so my life has gotten pretty restrictive but my multiple sclerosis has not gotten any worse in 5 years and i wonder what would happen if i had been on a gmo / glycosphate / agent orage / whateverthecrap they want to feed us . i feel totally let down by my government not even labeling them . fortunately the money i save from not eating at restaurants has helped me to afford my organic food . it makes me ashamed to be an american , frankly.is there any update to the gmo debate ? : - ( after watching the documentary ‘ genetic roulette ’ like what the good dr. don forrester m.d. suggested . i don ’ t ever want to eat gmos products again and i ’ m not alone in that line of thought . you can see clearly in the movie that there is plenty to be worried about and thus gmos should be avoided . at the very least labeled like gluten and nuts are . gmos labeling needs to happen and the fact that monsanto spent 43mil in deceptive advertising here in california to defeat labling speaks volumes about the companies deceptive ways . what are they hiding ? scary stuff gmos … again , just watch ‘ genetic roulette and make up your own mind . don ’ t listen to the paid shills like a few people in this thread defending gmos . watch the documentaries and maek up your own mind . knowledge is power.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

419	what 's the best low calorie sweetener ? i was unable to understand the name of the sweetener you suggested in the recipe for homemade cranberry juice in the video of 12 / 03 . i ’ d be grateful if you could send along the spelling of the product . don brix / originally posted on pink juice with green foam “ erythritol , ” a nearly noncaloric sugar alcohol found naturally in certain fruits . i have a video about it here : a harmless artificial sweetener . my family goes through about a pound a month . see , for example , our pink juice with green foam and healthy chocolate ice cream recipes . a study published last month adds a cautionary note , though : consuming erythritol with a large load of fructose ( as can be found in certain confectionery and soft drinks ) could inhibit fructose absorption in the small intestine and result in bloating and discomfort from fructose fermentation in the colon . i don ’ t imagine people would typically be mixing their diet and regular soda together , but if they did , it could be a bad combo . i have another erythritol video queued up from volume 11 so stay tuned and make sure you ’ re subscribed so you don ’ t miss it ! what about zsweet ? stephen , zsweet is erythritol that dr. greger uses and recommends . zsweet also contains “ natural flavors ” which is very nonspecific.zsweet includes stevia as one of its “ natural botanical extracts ” , most likely to increase sweetness to sucrose like levels. http : / / zsweet.com / htmls / faq / zsweet-ingredients.html there remains debate on the safety of stevia . the center for science in the public interest ’ s has a page on stevia : http : / / www.cspinet.org / stevia / there are a number of brands of pure erythritol : now foods , wholesome sweeteners , emerald forest and others.stevia is available in canada.sold by ? i bought mine from us amazon over a year ago , but haven ’ t used much.i started using glycine ( the mildly-sweet simplest amino acid ) instead as my beverage sweetener , as it may both clear excess methionine and increase glutathione synthesis.what about stevia ? xylitol ? coconut sap nectar ? i tried it ( erythritol ) and it is 70 % sweetness of sugar .. it was ok . saw recently about monk fruit … { lo han drops } .. wondering about this and it ’ s safety . i love date sugar for cooking as you recommended ! thank you for all your information ! i read an article that maple syrup is rich in antioxidant and have equivalent heath benefices than superfood . is it possible that this sweetener will become the next best sweetener ? if no , what make it less interesting ? http : / / www.theglobeandmail.com / life / the-hot-button / is-maple-syrup-the-new-super-food / article613045 / what is your educated opinion about the monk fruit extract , ( butanic name of the fruit siratia grosvenori momordica / mogroside ) yes , i would like to know about monk fruit as well . it is sold in packets and marketed as nectresse . it has erythritol in it , but claims to be mostly made of monk fruit.luo han guo is the natural extract from monk fruit . like stevia , it is extremely sweet and non-caloric . erythritol is used largely as a filler in this product , because , like pure stevia , luo han guo is super-sweet.what about yacon syrup ? certainly , natural stevia appears to be safe for human consumption . while stevia is relatively new to the us , it has been consumed in japan in quantity for over 40 years . have any detrimental effects of regular stevia consumption by those in japan been discovered ? “ fructose fermentation in the colon ” and i ’ m betting there ’ s a beverage snob out there that would pay top dollar for one to expunge that potent potion into a glass for his consumption ! - - -
