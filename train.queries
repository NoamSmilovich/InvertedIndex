5	treating asthma with plants vs. pills in my video treating asthma with fruits and vegetables , i highlighted a landmark study on manipulating antioxidant intake in asthma . the study found that just a few extra fruits and vegetables a day can powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates . if the antioxidants in the plants are ameliorating asthma , then why can ’ t we take antioxidant pills instead ? because antioxidant pills don ’ t appear to work . studies using antioxidant supplements on respiratory or allergic diseases have mostly shown no beneficial effects . this discrepancy between data relating to fruit and vegetable intake compared with those using antioxidant supplements may indicate the importance of the whole food , rather than individual components . for example , in the harvard nurse ’ s health study , women who got the most vitamin e from their diet appeared to be at half the risk for asthma , ( which may help explain why nut consumption is associated with significantly lower rates of wheezing ) , but vitamin e supplements did not appear to help . men who eat a lot of apples appear to have superior lung function , as do kids who eat fresh fruit every day , as measured by fev1 ( basically how much air you can forcibly blow out in one second ) . the more fruit , salad , and green vegetables kids ate , the greater their lung function appeared . researchers are “ cautious about concluding which nutrient might be responsible . ” there ’ s vitamin c in fruits , salads , and green vegetables , but there are lots of other antioxidants , such as “ vitamin p , ” a term used to describe polyphenol phytonutrients found in grapes , flax seeds , beans , berries , broccoli , apples , citrus , herbs , tea , and soy . polyphenol phytonutrients can directly bind to allergenic proteins and render them hypoallergenic , allowing them to slip under our body ’ s radar . if this first line of defense fails , polyphenols can also inhibit the activation of the allergic response and prevent the ensuing inflammation , and so may not only work for prevention , but for treatment as well . most of the available evidence is weak , though , in terms of using supplements containing isolated phytonutrients to treat allergic diseases . we could just give people fruits and vegetables to eat , but then we couldn ’ t perform a double-blind study to see if they work better than placebo . some researchers decided to use pills containing plant food extracts . plant extracts are kind of a middle ground . they are better than isolated plant chemicals , but are not as complete as whole foods . still , since we can ’ t put whole foods in a capsule , we can compare the extracts to fake sugar pills that look and feel the same to see if they have an effect . the first trial involved giving people extracts of apple skins . i ’ ve talked about the japan ’ s big cedar allergy problem before ( see alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies ) , so apple extract pills were given every day for a few months starting right before pollen season started . the results were pretty disappointing . they found maybe a little less sneezing , but the extract didn ’ t seem to help their stuffy noses or itchy eyes . what about a tomato extract ? a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled eight-week trial was performed on perennial allergic rhinitis , this time not for seasonal pollen , but for year-round allergies to things like dust-mites . there are lots of drugs out there , but you may have to take them every day year-round , so how about some tomato pills instead ? after oral administration of tomato extract for eight weeks , there was a significant improvement of total nasal symptom scores , combined sneezing , runny nose and nasal obstruction , with no apparent adverse effects . would whole tomatoes work even better ? if only researchers would design an experiment directly comparing phytonutrient supplements to actual fruits and vegetables head-to-head against asthma , but such a study had never been done … until now . the same amazing study , highlighted in my video , treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? , that compared the seven-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet to the three-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet , after completion of its first phase , commenced a parallel , randomized , controlled supplementation trial with capsules of tomato extract , which boosted the power of five tomatoes in one little pill , and the study subjects were given three pills a day . who did better , the group that ate seven servings of actual fruits and vegetables a day , or the group that ate three servings a day but also took 15 supposed serving equivalents in pill form ? the pills didn ’ t help at all . improvements in lung function and asthma control were evident only after increased fruit and vegetable intake , which suggests that whole-food interventions are most effective . both the supplements and increased fruit and vegetable intake were effective methods for increasing carotenoid concentrations in the bloodstream , but who cares ? clinical improvements — getting better from disease — were evident only as a result of an increase in plant , not pill , consumption . the results provide further evidence that whole-food approaches should be used to achieve maximum efficacy of antioxidant interventions . and if this is what a few more plants can do , what might a whole diet composed of plants accomplish ? see treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . i also dealt with preventing asthma in the first place : preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables . the theme of whole foods being more efficacious than supplements seems to come up over and over again . see for example : more on “ vitamin p ” in how to slow brain aging by two years . the anti-inflammatory effects of nuts may explain the harvard nurse ’ s health study finding : fighting inflammation in a nut shell . maybe the asthma trick is in what not to eat . if they ate a pill instead of the whole fruit , they would not displaced the animal foods ( could be allergenic in some people ) . they would eat the same diet plus the extra pill . switching the thought process of missing something ( a + $ $ $ pill ) to taking something out ( animal - $ $ $ ) could be scientific too.vegan regimen with reduced medication in the treatment of bronchial asthma . : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 4019393thanks for the study link . from the related articles it looks like yoga can help , too.as an asthma sufferer , i can say that pills help tremendously . if i take around 7,000 mg vitamin c a day , my symptoms are greatly decreased . but i have to take at least that much or no benefits . i ’ d like to see studies on taking much more vitamin c than what ’ s normally recommended . i ’ ve had friends who do vitamin c iv ’ s … around 50,000mg given through the blood . prescribed by a doctor of course . it totally stops their symptoms . maybe the fillers in vitamins have something to do with effectiveness ? hi amanda . thanks for you comment . i suppose the fillers could be problematic if allergic to a substance that it contains . good to know your doctor is prescribing the high dose vitamin c and you are not injecting yourself ! if it works for you and you ’ re finding relief then more power to ya ! so many folks suffer from asthma ( like my baby cousin ) that i am happy to hear when something works.have you tried having your vitamin d3 levels checked ? here ’ s what boggles the mind . my choice then is to either ( a ) pick a juicy , healthy , fruit off a tree ( or buy it for peanuts at the local market ) and enjoy it as a snack , or ( b ) pop something that has been processed to the hilt with artificial flavouring ( gross ) , that would cost me more , has negligible benefits and perhaps even a negative side effect or two to boot . why would we willingly spend money on something so distasteful when a perfectly tastier , healthier , cheaper option is available ? what am i missing here ? ? sounds good to me ! perhaps convenience and unhealthful dietary patterns interfere with choosing fresh fruits and vegetables ? access to foods could be another part , but i agree with you 100 % that choice “ a ” is preferred . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed ! thanks for your comment , tikiri.it ’ s unfortunate the nutritionfacts articles do not carry citations as do the videos . i ’ m curious as to what “ extracts ” are and whether they differ from “ concentrates ” , as in juice plus.hi steve , the following sources regarding apple and tomato extracts are hyperlinked within the text above : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15849424http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17519582http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22854412thanks . i should have noticed that.the hyperlinks for individual studies aren ’ t bolded as the video titles are , and are a rather subdued green as opposed to the bright blue we ’ re used to seeing . they can be easy to miss ! enjoy the articles . : ) thanks for asking , steve. b00mer is right we do link the studies but they are in the hyperlinks for blogs . you can still find them . the study will go into more depth on type of extract . as for “ juice plus ” , dr. greger has a few videos on that supplement.thanks.last october my son was coming to visit and he is a vegan . i bought almond milk in preparation for his arrival , so for about a week i was not drinking dairy . i began to notice that my breathing was easier . after he left i took myself off all dairy and within another week was off my asthma meds . no more daily inhaled steroids . i ’ m also off benadryl now . if i get around cats and dogs for extended periods i might need a rescue inhaler , but overall my symptoms are much better.wow that is amazing ! dairy can be a major allergen for many folks . i am so glad you are finding relief . that ’ s why i love nutritionfacts.org because the public can visit the site for free and learn about crucial nutrition topics . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed . thanks , jim.i know what you mean about dairy.when i was a kid i had asthma i drank milk back then as i got older i drank less milk but more sodas but my asthma went away.never made the connection until about a year ago when i found out the real truth about dairy.this spring when the pollen was falling like snow everyone around me was sniffing and snorting and complaining about congestion but i was free and clear.i tell everyone i talk to about diet that if you want better health at least ditch the dairy at least ; ) so the big idea is more fruits and vegetables for more plant fiber . we recommend bacon ! made from eggplant . here is a link to our vegan bacon video . spoiler alert : there ’ s turmeric in there . < 3 whirled peas kitchen https : / / youtu.be / avcpoqhwpocallan : another winner ! i ’ ve heard of processed vegan bacon , coconut bacon , and of course , tempeh bacon . i ’ ve never heard of eggplant bacon before this . you make it look absolutely delicious . and i really liked how you gave the overview at the beginning.that ’ s too much work for me . but sure do hope i will get to try it some time in the future . thanks for the link ! just a heads-up on some scary tv viewing tonight on frontline . hunting the nightmare bacteria . can also be seen online . it gives good reason to stay healthy and avoid all hospital stays.asthma is not dependant on vitamin c. vitamin d3 has been found in a number of people to treat and cure asthma . you can read “ the miraculous results of extremely high doses of the sunshine hormone vitamin d3 my experiment with huge doses of d3 from 25,000 to 50,000 to 100,000 iu a day over a 1 year period ” by jeff bowles for more information on how to use d3 to cure asthma . many people are very deficient in vitamin c and vitamin e , those being some of the vitamins lost to the mills.i ’ m confused about reaching 9-13 servings of fruits and vegetables , as the usda uses cups now instead . when you refer to a serving of fruit , is that the previously used usda serving size of about 1 / 2 cup for most and 1 cup for leafy greens ? or is each serving now 1 cup for most and 2 cups for leafy greens ? i find references to both measurements as a serving online . i don ’ t think i ’ m the only one confused ! : ) thank you so much ! i agree with lilackitty , this is an important question . how much exactly is a “ serving ? ” thank you , drs. greger and gonzales , for the constant stream of life giving information.good questions . the guidelines always seem to be changing . usda now uses cups . 5 cups ( servings ) total of fruits and vegetables is the minimum to shoot for , but more is definitely preferred . here is a guide to what counts as a serving for vegetables and fruits. allergies , antioxidants , apples , asthma , beans , berries , broccoli , children , citrus , flax seeds , fruit , grapes , harvard nurses ' health study , herbs , inflammation , japan , lung disease , lung health , nuts , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , polyphenols , protein , respiratory infections , salads , soy , sugar , supplements , tea , tomatoes , vegetables , vitamin c , vitamin e - -
6	how fruits and vegetables can treat asthma in my video preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables , i highlighted an international study of asthma and allergies involving more than a million kids . the study found a consistent inverse relationship between prevalence rates of asthma , allergies , and eczema and the intake of plants , starch , grains , and vegetables . researchers speculated “ over a decade ago that if these findings could be generalized , and if the average daily consumption of these foods increased , an important decrease in symptom prevalence could be achieved . ” no need to speculate any more , though , because plants were finally put to the test . researchers have proposed that “ by eating fewer fruits and vegetables , the susceptibility to potentially harmful inhaled substances of the population as a whole may be increased because of the reduction in antioxidant defenses of the lungs . ” the thin lining of fluid that forms the interface between our respiratory tract and the external environment is our first line of defense against oxidative damage . oxidative damage is important in asthma , contributing to airway contraction , excessive mucous production , and hypersensitivity . antioxidants protect against oxidative stress , so our lung lining contains a range of antioxidants our body makes itself , as well as those obtained from our diet , particularly from fruits and vegetables . we can even quantify the level of oxidative stress in people by measuring the level of oxidation products in their exhaled breath , which drops as we start eating more fruits and vegetables , and drops further as we combine more plants with fewer animal foods . do those with asthma really have lower levels of antioxidants than people without asthma ? compared to healthy controls , subjects with asthma had lower whole blood levels of total carotenoids and lower levels of each of the individual phytonutrients they measured : cryptoxanthin , lycopene , lutein , alpha-carotene and beta-carotene compared to healthy controls . therefore , they posit , “ the accumulating evidence does suggest that diet has an influence in modulating the response of the lung to inhaled allergens and irritants . however , it is possible that the reduced carotenoid levels in asthma are a result of increased utilization in the presence of excess free radicals . ” so it ’ s like a chicken-or-the-egg phenomenon . we know antioxidant-rich diets have been associated with reduced asthma prevalence . however , direct evidence that altering intake of antioxidant-rich foods actually affects asthma was lacking , until now . there are two ways to test the effects of fruits and vegetables on asthma . add fruits and vegetables to people ’ s diets and see if their asthma improves , or take asthmatics and remove fruits and vegetables from their diets and see if they get worse . the first such study of its kind , highlighted in my video , treating asthma with fruits and vegetables , placed subjects with asthma on a low antioxidant diet . after just a matter of days , there was a significant worsening of lung function and asthma control . the researchers conclude that , “ this finding is highly significant for subjects with asthma , as it indicates that omitting antioxidant-rich foods from the diet , for even a short time frame , will have a detrimental effect on asthma symptoms . ” ironically , the low antioxidant diet consumed by subjects , where they were restricted to one serving of fruit and up to two servings of vegetables per day , is typical of western diets . in other words , the low antioxidant diet they used to worsen people ’ s asthma , crippling their lung function , was just like the standard american diet . as about “ half the population usually consumes a diet with an intake of fruit and vegetables equivalent to that in the study diet or less , it appears likely that this dietary pattern , which must be considered suboptimal for lung health , may have a significant impact on asthma management , indicating the potential for typical western dietary patterns to contribute to a worsening of lung function and asthma control . ” within just days , cutting down fruit and vegetable intake can impair lung function , but does adding fruits and vegetables help with asthma ? that was the second phase of the study . asthmatics on the standard american diet had about a 40 % chance of relapsing into an asthma exacerbation within three months . however , put them on seven servings of fruits and vegetables a day instead of three , and we cut their exacerbation rate in half , down to 20 % . imagine if there were a drug that could work as powerfully as a few fruits and vegetables . if manipulating antioxidant intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake can so powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates , why not just take antioxidant pills instead ? i cover that in my video treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? and if a few extra servings of fruits and vegetables can make that kind of difference , what about a whole diet composed of plants ? check out treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . what else might antioxidant-rich diets help with ? see : how many antioxidants should we shoot for ? see : where are antioxidants found the most ? i ’ m not surprised , but since i have had a melanoma , what do you think of that association of citrus with melanoma ? i don ’ t think growing up in australia and getting a widespread deep partial thickness sunburn that caused me to miss 6 weeks of school helped much . i also wonder if kids near citrus eat more and if it is really the sun exposure ? hi robert . a few site users were discussing this in an earlier blog . see our comments and links , here . from one study mentioned it seems citrus juice and grapefruit was the potential culprits , but the authors conclude more research is needed before any strict claims against citrus is confirmed.thank you.a psoralen video highlighting the foods that contain it would be timely by dr. greger . figs , citrus , celery , and much more . these foods can increase sunburn potential , for some in a real bad way . i get fried after eating celery and figs . badly . lips burn real bad after figs and getting some sunshine . very few aware of this phenomenon.it is worth reading the study if you have a history of melanoma . they carefully controlled for sun exposure and a bunch of other things . it is the second time this association has been found ( albeit the first time was with one of the two cohorts in the study ) . it is diet in adults they looked at , not kids . the researchers suspect it is to do with the psoralens in citrus ; note that psoralens are also high in a large family of veges that includes carrots , celery , parsnip , parsely , coriander , cumin , dill and others . for those of us with past severe sunburn and melanoma history the dna damage is already done , but it may pay to consider the amount of psoralens in your diet so as not to encourage progression of other melanomas – eg , not to consume a lot of carrot and orange / celery juice.thank you very much . i am an md , like dr greger , who thinks that diet and other lifestyle interventions are the most important interventions . i will take your advice kate and follow the study . i am so glad dr greger added joseph gonzales rd as he is prompt and thoughtful.i ’ ve been grappling with the issues of plant based diet now for over a year now , and wish there were more about how to ensure we get it right . my blood sugar went up , my teeth are suffering , the carbs are high on this diet compared to my old meaty , fattier one . but i got rid of acid reflux and lost weight on the plant based diet . i intend to win at it , but it ’ s not as easy as changing one ’ s food preferences . dr. greger sometimes gives us glimpses of his diet and that is very helpful . the blueberry amla soymilk smoothie i ’ m going to try out . i know his would not necessarily be for everyone , but it would help to have his menu and supplement choices as a sample of workable plan that has the research behind it , not that it ’ s medical advice , just common sense gained from observing research . when i mention the whole food plant-based diet to people , they are often sold already , but have heard horror stories or tried it themselves without a good plan and failed . they were not happy they had to abandon it , since they like the good effects . it ’ s sort of sad.bobluhrs : i ’ m glad you are having some partial success . i agree that the devil is in the details and it would be better to have full success . i also agree that seeing some meal plans that are backed by the best science is very helpful . i have some ideas for you : 1 ) check out the book , “ becoming vegan – express edition ” by brenda davis and vesanto melina . dr. greger has spoken highly of these authors and even had them as a guest blogger on this site . the book is excellent , extremely well researched , and includes some sample meal plans for varying levels of calorie needs . i consider it more of a reference book than a read-cover-to-cover book . so , it ’ s not a big investment in time to check out the book.2 ) 21 days of free meal plans – if you participate in the free pcrm ( physician ’ s committee for responsible medicine ) 21 day kickstart program , you will get 21 day ’ s worth of meal plans developed by top nutritionists . i believe that dr. greger has spoken support for this program and in addition to meal plans : they will hold your hand for 21 days , including recipes , videos , inspirational messages , and a forum where you can ask questions . the forum is monitored by a very respected rd. http : / / www.pcrm.org / kickstarthome / ( click the green “ register now ” button . ) 3 ) here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . it ’ s not quite the meal plans you are looking for , but it gives some great general advice that you will want to keep in mind , including b12 : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.i second thea ’ s recommendation of davis and melina . i have the expanded edition . it ’ s permanently on my nightstand and i refer to it all the time . everything in it is based on science , not on hunches or feelings . just the data in tables and charts are worth the price.i agree so much ! ! ! i got a great glimpse when dr. g. said he had yams / sweet potatoes with dried cranberries , etc . , sprinkled with cinnamon for breakfast one day . i tried something similar and had kabocha squash with frozen blueberries mixed in and sprinkled with cinnamon . it was delicious , and i never would have thought of it without having seen dr. g ’ s breakfast comment one day.i ´ m vegan for many years , but there is no improvement in my asthma . i need an inhaler for most of the year . seven servings of fruit and vegetables are a lot . i dont eat this every day . but i will try this in the next weeks . best regards from germany , rubenvitamin d3 , or rather the hormone like substance d3 , can treat and reduce the incidence of asthma attacks. http : / / www.webmd.com / asthma / news / 20100910 / vitamin-d-may-improve-asthma-control vitamin d3 is recommended on this site for all people . sunlight would probably be better . modern windows are uv opaque and probably let less d3 be made when people sit next to the them than ever before . i am interested in the d content of foods . i think cooking destroys it . plants use vitamin d and it may be present in fruits.my asthma resolved shortly after i eliminated all dairy products from my diet , around 25 years ago . i used to need to carry my inhaler with me at all times just in case i experienced a flare up . haven ’ t touched one in over two decades now and feel great ! should have made the move from veggie to vegan sooner … i ’ m confused about reaching 9-13 servings of fruits and vegetables , as the usda uses cups now instead . when you refer to a serving of fruit , is that the previously used usda serving size of about 1 / 2 cup for most and 1 cup for leafy greens ? or is each serving now 1 cup for most and 2 cups for leafy greens ? i find references to both measurements as a serving online . i don ’ t think i ’ m the only one confused ! : ) thank you so much ! allergies , alpha-carotene , animal products , antioxidants

7	how fruits and vegetables can prevent asthma asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and the prevalence is increasing around the world . despite this , most research dollars are spent on adult chronic disease . “ one might ask , ” a group of researchers posited “ whether this is because our politicians and senior administrators feel themselves to be more likely to suffer from the latter , and thus ignore allergic diseases as they mostly impact children and young adults ” – who don ’ t vote . an enormous study about asthma and allergies in childhood , highlighted in my video , preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables , was published that includes more than a million children in nearly a hundred countries , making it the most comprehensive survey of asthma and allergies ever undertaken . the researchers found striking worldwide variations in the prevalence and severity of asthma , allergies , and eczema — a 20 to 60-fold difference in prevalence of symptoms of asthma , allergic runny nose , and atopic eczema around the world . the large variability suggests a crucial role of local characteristics that are determining the differences in prevalence between one place and another . what kind of environmental factors ? why does the prevalence of itchy eyes and runny noses range anywhere from 1 % in india , for example , and up to 45 % of kids elsewhere ? there were some associations with regional air pollution and smoking rates , but the most significant associations were with diet . adolescents showed a consistent pattern of decreases in symptoms of wheeze ( current and severe ) , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic eczema with increases in per capita consumption of plant foods . the more their calories and protein came from plant sources , the less allergies they tended to have . in general , there seems to be an association between an increase in asthma prevalence and a decrease in consumption of fresh fruits , green vegetables , and other dietary sources of antioxidants , helping to explain why the prevalence of asthma and respiratory symptoms is lower in populations with high intake of foods of plant origin . high intakes of fat and sodium , and low intakes of fiber and carbohydrates , are linked with asthma , while traditional and vegetarian diets are associated with lower rates . for example , if we look closer within india , in a study of more than 100,000 people , “ those who consumed meat ( daily or occasionally ) were more likely to report asthma than those who were strictly vegetarian . ” this also meant avoiding eggs . eggs have been associated ( along with soft drink consumption ) with increased risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma in schoolchildren . on the other hand , consumptions of soy foods and fruits were associated with reduced risk of respiratory symptoms . in fact , removing eggs and dairy from the diet may improve lung function in asthmatic children in as little as eight weeks . therefore , it may be a combination of eating fewer animal foods and more plants . high vegetable intake , for example , has been found protective in children , potentially cutting the odds of allergic asthma in half . and fruit has also shown a consistent protective association for current and severe wheeze and runny nose in adolescents , and for current and severe asthma , allergies , and eczema in children . why is this ? i ’ ve talked about the endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants ( see dietary sources of alkylphenol endocrine disruptors ) building up in the meat supply that may increase the risk of allergic disease , but the increase in asthma may be a combination of both a more toxic environment and a more susceptible population . one review notes that , “ the dietary changes which have occurred over recent years may have led to a reduction in these natural antioxidant defenses , resulting in a shift of the antioxidant status of the whole population and leading to increased susceptibility to oxidant attack and airway inflammation . ” in adults , for example , the risk of airway hyper-reactivity may increase seven-fold among those with the lowest intake of vitamin c from plant foods , while those with the lowest intake of saturated fats may have a 10-fold protection , presumably because of saturated fat ’ s role in triggering inflammation . the protective effect of plant-based food may also be mediated through effects on intestinal microflora . it turns out that differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood . kids with allergies , for example , tend to be less likely to harbor lactobacilli , the good bacteria that ’ s found in fermented foods , and naturally on many fruits and vegetables . lactobacillus probiotics may actually help with childhood asthma , which may help explain why children raised on largely organic vegetarian diets may have a lower prevalence of allergic reactions . infants raised this way tend to have more good lactobacilli in their guts compared to controls , though they were also more likely to have been born naturally , breastfed longer , and not been given antibiotics , so we can ’ t really tell if it ’ s the diet until we put it to the test ( see treating asthma with fruits and vegetables ) . more on preventing allergic diseases can be found in my videos preventing childhood allergies and preventing allergies in adulthood . more on protecting lung function with fruits and vegetables can be found in preventing copd with diet . surprised probiotics can affect immune function ? check out my video preventing the common cold with probiotics ? and if you think that is wild , wait until you see gut feelings : probiotics and mental health . what might be in plants that ’ s so beneficial ? see anti-inflammatory antioxidants . what might be in animal products that is harmful to lung function ? there are endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in the food chain that may be playing a role . see my video alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies . also there ’ s an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs that may contribute to inflammation as well . see inflammatory remarks about arachidonic acid . choosing fragrance-free personal care products may also help reduce airway reactivity : throw household products off the scent . i compare the efficacy of plants to pills ( treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? ) and explore the role an entire diet filled with plants might play in treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . wow ! ! all the more reason to eat loads of fruits and veggies ! ! but seeing this makes me wonder about that new study about citrus fruits . it doesn ’ t make sense that eating an orange or grapefruit each day could cause melanoma ! ! do you see this as an accurate study ? or , is it an example of “ more is not always better ” ? i have never heard of citrus causing melanoma . feel free to share any link or study that discusses this more . it seems like when it comes to fruits more is better ! yes , it was in the news yesterday . i think it might have some validity . consider that lemon and lime juice on top of the skin makes someone very photosensitive . maybe there are folks with leaky guts or some sort of indigestion / bad digestion of food ( or unhealthy macrobiome ) that allows ingested citrus to travel towards the skin , sweating it out , who knows . these science on this that came out really seems relevant and thorough , and has raised red flags.thanks ! citrus has been identified as a “ trigger ” for pain in patients with migraine headaches and arthritis , but to my knowledge this is very rare.guest , you may be on to something about leaky gut and citrus . 3 yrs ago i started drinking 1 / 2 a lemon in a glass of water . i have no history of ever being allergic to any food , even had the standard test done and nothing showed up . i guess it didn ’ t include lemon.anyways i ended up with hives all over my body . red bumps that also itched . after freaking out about that for a while i spent $ 100 to see a dermatologist and they prescribed me some prednisome . but before i took that it dawned on me to stop the lemon juice first , and very soon the hives left me . i guess as you get older something new might pop up . about the only citrus i eat now is maybe some orange on a salad.i haven ’ t heard or seen this , but if there is any validity at all , i am sure it is because of what gets done to it chemically in growth and processing , not the inherent fruit quality.maybe people who eat more citrus also live in warm climates where citrus is grown and get more sun exposure . could be a factor ! i usually eat one type or another of citrus each day , so i may need to stop ! thanks for such prompt replies ! ! ! i love the work that goes on here at nutrition facts ! ! ! ! ! well , if you are not experiencing any pain or discomfort i would suggest eating all the citrus you want ! just look at how healthful the stuff is ! here is a little ditty on citrus , if interested . thanks , lauraleah ! of course , ultimately it ’ s up to you to decided what ’ s best to eat . glad you are finding some helpful tips here at nutritionfacts . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed.best , josephjust a thought to add here and that is consideration for people like me whose asthma is triggered by a salicylate sensitivity . i know i am not in the “ average ” group of those whose trigger is this , but i do know of at least two other persons in my area who have this too . we were all diagnosed with it by allergists . we must be careful how much fruit and veggies we eat and are equipped with our lists that tell us which fruit and veggies are “ very high ” , “ high ” etc for salicylate ( which is nature ’ s preservative of the fruit or vegetable ) . ps i just love your site and it is helping me and so many others cheers , anncitrus fruit and melanoma : is there any link ? grapefruit and melanoma : what ’ s happening here ? an association , yes . but is there a real risk ? thanks for the links ! also , as i often say on this blog , don ’ t forget that the total diet is important . i have checked out these references and find that the poor citrus has been taken out of context . as walt willet , md , of harvard says , “ food is a package deal . ” nearly all of the health professionals in the cited studies were carnivores . dr campbell comments on this in his excellent book , the china study . so , what we are really seeing in these studies is the possible effects of citrus within the context of a meaty diet . does that apply to you ? anyone seen any studies of the frugivore vegans – do they have a higher incidence of malignant melanoma ? or what about the low fat , whole food vegans ? it is my understanding that these last two groups are , in fact , widely known for their excellent skin quality and generally low cancer rates . wasn ’ t there a study a few years ago that attributed cancer in general to low fruit consumption ?

8	our tax dollars subsidize unhealthy foods why do food companies sell junk ? because unhealthy commodities are highly profitable . this is in part because of their “ low production cost , long shelf-life , and high retail value , ” which create perverse incentives for industries to market and sell more junk . in a study highlighted in my video , taxpayer subsidies for unhealthy foods , researchers at the university of cambridge stated , “ coca-cola ’ s net profit margins , for example , are about a quarter of the retail price , making soft drink production , alongside tobacco production , among the most profitable industrial activities in the world . ” one of the reasons production costs are so low is that we tax-payers subsidize them . distinguished unc professor of nutrition , barry popkin , writes : “ for more than a century , western governments have invested heavily in lowering the costs of animal products and some basic cash crops [ such as sugar ] . accordingly , western diets have shifted during the past century , especially after world war ii , to include more animal sourced foods — meat , poultry , dairy , seafood , and eggs [ as well as more sugar and corn syrup ] . during this same period , however , we have begun to realize that a healthy diet actually requires fewer animal products and empty calories , and more vegetables , fruits , beans , and whole grains . redressing this balance is a complex task requiring not only a shift in agricultural investment and policy , but also changes in social preferences that have developed over decades , in part due to dollar menu meat . ” why is chicken so cheap ? in the nine years that followed the passage of the ‘ 96 farm bill , corn and soy were subsidized below the cost of production to make cheap animal feed . so , u.s. tax-payers effectively handed the chicken and pork industry around $ 10 billion dollars each . what if we instead subsidized healthy foods ? or taxed harmful ones ? every dollar spent taxing processed foods or milk would net an estimated $ 2 in healthcare cost savings . every dollar spent making vegetables cheaper would net $ 3 , and subsidizing whole grains could net over a one thousand percent return on our investment . unfortunately , we can ’ t count on big broccoli . the produce sector lacks the extensive funding that went to create the national dairy council , the national cattlemen ’ s beef association , the national pork producers council , and the american egg board . even if we removed the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual subsidies for animal products , it might not be sufficient to tip the balance in favor of healthier diets . according to professor popkin , “ we have created societies in the west that value and consume meat , dairy , poultry , fish and seafood . over several generations , a particular way of life has been promoted that has shifted expectations about diet to include large amounts of animal-sourced foods ” — the concept that a meal centers around some hunk of meat . the idea that animal products should form the basis of our diet has been scientifically debunked , but remains the social aspiration of billions of people . as we in the west slowly come to accept that our diets and eating habits are not healthy , it is to be hoped that this will change policies not only here , but throughout the world . for more on the power big food ’ s hold over our political system , check out videos such as : my video series on corporate influence over our federal nutrition guidelines may also be enlightening : and if we really wanted to save our country money we could start by trying to wipe out some of our leading killer chronic diseases : what is that food product ? frozen yogurt stuff ? fake crab ? it ’ s a block of spam with uncle sam . note : you can always find the image credit at the bottom of the blog for more information about the picture.nf always has such great ( and artistic ) graphics , photos , and visual aids.many of the foreign students my daughter met in college were shocked by how inexpensive meat is in the us . they were from countries where meat is one of the most expensive foods … .which it really is in the us ( without subsidies ) as well.here ’ s a question from an earlier video : dr. greger reported on how piperine significantly ( up to 2000 % ! ) boosts the bioavailability of curcumin , but stopped short , it seemed to me , of recommending that one routinely combine black pepper and turmeric to have those effects . in an earlier talk by dr. greger for rouxbe cooking school , he seemed appalled at the proposition , but perhaps he has changed his point of view ? since the effects might be quite significant , i ’ d appreciate a clarification re the desirability of combining pepper with turmeric both for 1 ) those looking to prevent chronic metabolic diseases and for 2 ) those currently coping with such diseases . thanks ! cathy , piperine in black pepper increases the bioavailability of curcumin presumably by inhibiting an enzyme that participates in phase ii of the liver detoxification process . the problem is the same enzyme is responsible for the removal of some drugs and of some endogenous waste material . so , black pepper , while increasing there bioavailability of curcumin , increases the half life of some drugs , which is potentially dangerous . longer exposure to endogenous waste material may have negative effects as well . on the other hand , a lot of people eat black pepper with food regularly , apparently without any problems.thanks , george , for this clear explanation . i imagine anyone on medication that clears through the liver would be at risk if they boosted curcumin with piperine — a lot of people ! i use turmeric powder in a small dose of coconut oil to dissolve it and then i put it in a smoothie . i assume this is ok since i don ’ t use pepper ? dr. greger mentions that there are some people who should be careful about curcumin . please let me know if this helps answer your question.thanks joseph – so anyone taking medication which clears through the liver should be cautious ? if that ’ s so , perhaps dr. greger should express that qualifier , so people are advised before they jump on board the turmeric / pepper bandwagon . … .and the garlic bandwagon might also command a qualifier as john hopkins lupus center has advised that humans with autoimmune diseases / disorders should avoid garlic as well as ginseng , alfalfa , and some other stuff . ( john hopkins medical staff considered number one ( or two ) in the world ) . everything “ natural ” is not always in our best interest.poor underappreciated big broccoli . hey dr. greger , this ted talk reminded me of you : “ broccoli – the dna whisperer ” . https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hmfnzc3oz04you honestly believe if govt subsidized kale , we as americans would eat more kale ? count us in … kale and spinach salad is a family favorite , but hard to find spinach and kale fresh – they usually go bad within two days unless you can find them fresh , which is really rare even here in the middle of californiamaybe it is just wishful thinking on my part , but i feel a change is coming , though slowly ! people in general are waking up to the benefit of eating real food , at least more so than in the past , so hopefully the snowball will grow once it get ’ s rolling ! the internet has changed our interface with information gathering , which can be either negative or positive , depending on your good sense , or lack thereof , but the point is we can now find the info we need , if we know how and where to look ! it annoys me no end to see the bs that passes as fact for the sheeple who need to believe what they always have , so merely continue to buy into the subsidized agenda with no clue they are hopelessly brainwashed ! dr greger and others are the shining lights in this fog of noxious and dangerous “ spam ” ( above ) … ugh ! i clicked on the link for “ scientifically debunked ” in dr. greger ’ s post above and then skimmed part of the paper . i didn ’ t have time to read it in detail , but one sentence made me do a double-take , and then a triple take , and then a head scratch : “ rare was the scientist , such as weston price , whose studies of isolated indigenous populations prompted him to promote a vegetarian diet , or at least a diet with minimal meat , grown in natural environments ( price , 1981 ) . ​ ” wow . i wasn ’ t able to find the paper they were referencing to see more , but if this is an accurate representation of weston price ’ s work , that poor man must be raging from his grave to see what has been promoted in his memory . i * think * i remember plant positive talking about how weston price ’ s work has been twisted , but this is very interesting collaboration if true.you stumbled upon something amazing , thea . i followed the link too after reading your response , and found the same . they were actually not referencing a paper but price ’ s large book , nutrition and physical regeneration – the “ bible ” of the wapf . except it seems the organisation just cherry picks the thousands of case studies that it the “ high fat diet ” they promote . this books is a fascinating read , but just as that pub med article points out in such a startling way ( as you noticed ) price did not find that tribes who ate meat were big and strong and tribes that were vegetarian were weaklings . i ant aware he promoted a vegetarian diet at all ; i am not sure where that came from – but he certainly wasn ’ t a proponent of high meat and fat for all as the only way to be healthy . i see his actual focus more on “ no processed foods ” as the way to be healthy … which i think we ’ d all agree with . it ’ s also worth reminding ourselves that he was a dentist , focusing on oral health , and his ideas about nutrition and general heath were not founded on research as we see it today , but hypotheses . unfortunately , too many people saw them as facts . thanks for pointing out this amazing statement.mec : thanks for going the extra mile , looking into this , and then taking the time to report back . nice post.on the topic of the post , thank you dr. greger ! one of my pet peeves is how unhealthy foods like animal products are subsidized . i have long felt that if meat cost consumers what it actually costs the world ( including externalities – pollution , etc . ) , we would all be so healthy naturally . very few people would be able to afford meat regardless of their cultural biases . cultural biases would then ( probably / hopefully ? ) change over time … why can ’ t an organic vegetable council be formed and begin lobbying in washington d.c. ? lack of funding ? maybe . who wants to see an indiegogo funding project for “ big broccoli ” ? from news reports , i understand that organic produce is making huge profits in recent years . i think it ’ s time to start this veggie council.when folks at work learn that i eat plant based , they usually defend their consumption of animal products with a claim that they don ’ t feel satisfied / full unless they eat meat . how do i respond to that ? is it to do with gut microbiome ? i ’ ve heard that too . i think it ’ s because people don ’ t add enough starch to their meals . i ’ m not satisfied with a salad consisting of lettuce and chopped raw veggies , either . but when i add whole wheat pasta , brown rice , or a sweet potato , i feel more satisfied . i also like to add more protein and fat with beans , walnuts and various seeds . now we ’ re talking about a meal not an appetizer.like salads and fruit , pasta and rice leave me hungry – even if i literally eat more than my stomach should hold : every meal requires legumes , avocados , or nuts for me to feel full for more than 2 hours.phil c : i think that herb i. vore gave a great answer , but i also think it is only part of the answer . so , part of the problem is that people don ’ t know * how * to create a healthy meal that will satisfy them.another part , in my opinion , is psychological . since it is true , my answer to such a statement ( which i have heard several times before too ) often includes something along the lines of , “ i used to feel the same way . but as i started to eat more healthy , i realized that it was phychological . i was raised to think that i needed meat as part of the meal and that any dish without meat was the ‘ side ’ dish . so , of course i didn ’ t feel satisfied eating only a side dish . however , most people seem to find that when they start eating truly healthy whole foods , including plenty of good starches like beans and whole grains , and * enjoying * those foods and when they understand in their heads that such dishes are complete , then that feeling of satisfaction is there . ” i also think there is a third piece to this phenomenon that you touched on concerning gut stuff . have you seen this talk by michael klaper ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 0tjyb1wtxg4 anyway , this talk is speculation , but if it is true , then it may be that the person really does require some time to adjust to healthy eating . and you could explain that there is a possibility that they have harmed their bodies with the food they have eaten so far to the point where they are probably addicted to meat . they could wean themselves off of it if they wanted to … finally , the fourth piece is that there are some people who really aren ’ t interested in eating healthy and have never truly tried and are just saying what they * think * would happen if they gave it a try . ( because after eating the salad before the meal , they are still hungry . ) that situation requires a different response , but it would be hard to give such a response because if might come off as calling the person a liar.those are my thoughts . does that help ? american egg board , animal products , beans , chicken , coca cola , corn , corn syrup , cost savings , dairy eggs , empty calories , factory farming practices , farm bill , farmers , feed additives , fish , fruit , grains , industry influence , marketing , meat , medicare , milk , national cattlemen 's beef association , national dairy council , national pork producers council , pork , poultry , seafood , soda , soy , standard american diet , subsidies , sugar , tobacco , turkey , vegetables - -
9	reducing arsenic in chicken and rice in 2013 , maryland became the first state to ban the feeding of an arsenic-containing drug to chickens . this arsenic-containing drug is used to control parasites and gives chicken meat an “ appealing pink color . ” in 2011 , the fda found that the livers of chickens fed this drug had elevated levels of inorganic arsenic , a known human carcinogen . in response , the drug ’ s manufacturer , pfizer , voluntarily pulled the drug off the u.s. market . however , it ’ s still sold overseas — including to places that continue to export chicken back to us — and a similar arsenic-containing drug for use in poultry is still available in the united states . the maryland ban was still some help , though ; it kept maryland farmers from using stockpiles of the drug . how much arsenic gets into the actual meat and not just the internal organs ? we didn ’ t know until recently . in a study highlighted in my video , how many cancers caused by arsenic-laced chicken ? , researchers at the johns hopkins school of public health coordinated the purchase of chicken breasts off grocery store shelves in ten cities across the country . they found that 70 % of the samples of chicken meat from poultry producers that didn ’ t prohibit arsenic drugs were contaminated with the cancer-causing form of arsenic at levels that exceeded the safety thresholds originally set by the fda ( before the fda relented and admitted that there ’ s really no safe level of this kind of arsenic ) . when the drug was first approved , scientists believed that its organic arsenic base would be excreted unchanged ( organic arsenic is much less dangerous than inorganic arsenic ) . guess what appears to convert the drug into the carcinogenic form ? cooking . when chicken meat is cooked , levels of the arsenic-containing drug go down and levels of carcinogenic arsenic go up , suggesting the drug may degrade into the cancer-causing inorganic arsenic form during cooking . how much cancer are we talking about ? if we estimate that about three-quarters of americans eat chicken , then the arsenic in that chicken has potentially been causing more than 100 cases of cancer every year . the john hopkins researchers conclude that “ eliminating the use of arsenic-based drugs in [ poultry and pig ] production could reduce the burden of arsenic-related disease in the u.s. population . ” arsenic-containing drugs fed to chickens is one of the ways arsenic gets into rice . when we feed arsenic to chickens , the resulting arsenic-bearing poultry manure is introduced to the environment , soil , and water , and rice sucks it up from contaminated soil and can transfer it to people who don ’ t even eat chicken . there is massive environmental contamination from the poultry industry ; nearly two million pounds of arsenic has been poured into the environment every year by the u.s chicken industry alone . we ’ re even seeing arsenic in foods sweetened with organic brown rice syrup . it reminds me of the arsenic in apple juice story . although the u.s. made lead and arsenic-based pesticides illegal years ago , they still persist in the soil , so even organic products are not immune . there are other sources of arsenic ( such as naturally occurring arsenic deposits ) , but arsenic-containing poultry drugs have been deliberately administered to animals intended for human consumption for 70 years . consequently , exposures resulting from use of these drugs are far more controllable than are exposures from environmental sources . and the good news is that , thanks to a lawsuit from the center for food safety and other consumer groups , three out of the four arsenic-containing drugs fed to poultry have been officially pulled from the market . i ’ ve previously addressed this issue in my video arsenic in chicken . it ’ s nice to see there ’ s been some progress ! the antibiotics the poultry industry continues to feed chickens present another public health hazard . see my videos : cooking may also create other carcinogens from the muscle itself : “ and the good news is that , thanks to a lawsuit from the center for food safety and other consumer groups , three out of the four arsenic-containing drugs fed to poultry have been officially pulled from the market . ” is the remaining one drug still being fed to poultry nationwide ? is there any progress on banning the drugs internationally so they ’ re not poisoning the rest of the world and u.s. chicken eaters who are consuming imported chicken ? along similar lines , does anyone actually monitor the use of these banned substances , seeing as how they have stockpiles of them stashed away ? not really . if you ask an old cowboy named howard lyman he ’ ll tell you ranches stockpile illegal drugs and still use them today . when i interviewed him once he said not in 35 years had the usda ever came to his farm and asked questions.i am finding out . please sit tight ! seedy , thanks for your patience . dr. greger said “ the problem is that there are still stockpiles of the drug in use presumably but i think the one on the market is only sold for turkeys ” i also wrote a reply , here , ( just below ) about my interview with howard lyman back in 2008thanks so much for following up on this ! i ’ m not surprised by the answer . a sad state of affairs . and one of many reasons to avoid eating meat.i thought this was going to be an article on reducing arsenic in brown rice . wash thoroughly and cook using “ pasta ” method – several cups of water per cup of rice – pour off excess water after cooking.100 cases of cancer per hundreds of millions people per year doesn ’ t sound alarming compared to other threats.hey paul . that ’ s a great method for reducing arsenic in rice . thanks for sharing . it is important to note that the levels of arsenic in rice may not be as high when compared with other foods , and from the looks of it the main reason why our rice is contaminated with arsenic is due to poultry plants using it in the first place ! dr. greger has some great resources on food and arsenic . ​ he also compared arsenic levels of wild rice to brown rice in this ask the doctor q & a. ​ paul , i cook rice in a rice cooker . have you tried the “ pasta ” method using a rice cooker ? does it work ? how would you do that , exactly ? the convenience of the rice cooker is that you add the correct amount of water and the rice comes out nicely without excess water.what ’ s happening is that by providing extra cooking water one is hopefully leeching out more of the arsenic in that water ( and maybe nutrients : - ( its a pain , but what i sometimes do is strain the cooked rice and rinse in hot water ( if i want to be extra anal about it ) and put back in my pressure cooker in the “ warm ” mode to reheat and evaporate the remaining water . it really does take away from the convenience of a rice cooker or pressure cooker . damn poultry farms ! how about just soaking the rice overnight and discarding water ? thanks for continuing to bring to light ways we can better choose our food . without exposure , people are kept dumb , and that ’ s the way the food manufacturers want to keep it so you just blindly keep spending your money on what they offer . start your health path in a less toxic direction by getting the facts and share with your friends . it will make our world a better place to live.dr. greger : thank you for the article . i eat rice three meals a day almost everyday , so i ’ ve been concerned about arsenic in rice . is there a significant difference between white rice and brown rice with respect to the arsenic content ? a guest member supplied us with a link that looked at rice from different countries . i ’ ll post it , here . it is important to note that the levels of arsenic in rice may not be as high when compared with other foods . dr. greger has some great resources on food and arsenic . ​ he also compared arsenic levels of wild rice to brown rice in this ask the doctor q & a. ​ ​ i think it ’ s valuable to note when reports like these are published that perhaps many other foods containing arsenic were not tested ? i am not saying arsenic in rice is not concerning , but perhaps other foods also deserve awareness . the arsenic concentrates in the bran , so white rice would have less . i still do not think avoiding brown rice is necessary . in the report you can see what brands have the least . let me know if this helps ? thank you joseph and the guest so much for this article . i ’ d seen the original article in cr , but this is significantly revised and more detailed.thanks joseph and others here for the information and links . i have some reading to do . i ’ ve been wanting to switch my plant milk use to brown rice ( but hesitate due to the arsenic ) , from my current cashew milk – it ’ s so delicious , and so easy to make – but i want a similarly easy , healthful alternative that i can make , with less fat . anyone care to share their favorite , healthy , plant milk of choice ( grain or seed ) ? thank you ! ( btw : i ’ ve made quinoa “ milk ” – it ’ s good / easy to make too ) . maybe dr. greger has done a comparison on plant milks that i ’ ve missed . i ’ ll have to check that out too.you are welcome , tanya ! here are some links to videos on plant vs. cow ’ s calcium and and updated video on the same topic , here . here is one on almond milk vs. organic milk . the thought of making your own plant milks sounds amazing ! keep in mind it won ’ t have the vitamin and mineral core that is added to most plant-milks . however , you can certainly find those micronutrients elsewhere . i always suggest mixing it up a bit . i advocate for variety when it comes to foods like whole grains , beans , fruits , and veggies . the same could be said about plant-milks.thank you ! . good point on the lack of micronutrients in homemade plant-milks – i do try to get those elsewhere in my diet . yes , i agree , variety is key ! btw : here ’ s two simple rice / quinoa and cashew – milk recipes : http : / / www.absolutevegan.org / html / absolutevegan _ plantmilk _ recipe.html btw : as an ethical vegan , i need no convincing to avoid cow ’ s milk , a human health disaster , and the cause of unimaginable animal cruelty.oh gotcha . forgive me i was not trying to convince you ( or anyone ) to avoid cow ’ s milk . these videos are the only milk comparisons we have here so i thought i ’ d share . sorry if you had already seen . thanks for the recipe link i definitely need to try making my own ! oh – please , no apology needed ! the links are great – they offer ample science as to why we should all be avoiding milk & dairy in our diets … thanks again ! hey , i absolutely love oat milk , it ’ s super delicious and a bit sweeter than other plant milks . homemade hazelnut milk is also good but i don ’ t know how high the fat content would be in that one . i hardly ever drink oat milk though because of the packaging ( aluminum inside ) but you could always make it yourself : ) thanks dennis – i ’ ll find recipes and give both a try ! i ’ m sorry joseph , i meant to reply to tanya ! hey tanya , i accidentally replied to joseph ’ s comment instead of yours , you can find it below : ) watch your vitamin supplements , too . the industry often uses “ brown rice powder ” as a flow agent / capsule filler.garlic and other plants containing organosulfur compounds have been helpful in detoxifying arsenic . i know from personal experience . : - ) there may be a notion that organic brown rice has a lower arsenic level than conventional brown rice , but according to lundberg farms , their california-grown organic and conventional brown rice had the same level of inorganic arsenic present when tested . their test results are accessible via their website.yes. i contacted them and they told me just what you said.not much of a consolation for us currently , but very interesting all the same in regards to arsenic consumption : http : / / ehp.niehs.nih.gov / 121-a31 / apple juice , arsenic , brown rice syrup , cancer , carcinogens , center for food safety , chicken , cooking methods , fda , food additives , industrial toxins , johns hopkins university , lead , liver , meat , organic foods , parasites , persistent organic pollutants , pesticides , pork , poultry , rice , safety limits , turkey - -
10	how contaminated are our children ? in a study highlighted in my video , california childen are contaminated , researchers analyzed the diets of california children ages two through seven to determine the cancer and non-cancer health effects from food contaminant exposures . it turns out food may be the primary route of exposure to toxic heavy metals , persistent pollutants , and pesticides . “ though food-borne toxic contaminants are a concern for all ages , they are of greatest concern for children , who are disproportionately impacted because they ’ re still developing and have greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight . pediatric problems that have been linked to preventable environmental toxin exposures include cancer , asthma , lead poisoning , neurobehavioral disorders , learning and developmental disabilities , and birth defects . ” the good news is that changing one ’ s diet can change one ’ s exposure . quoting from the study , “ a diet high in fish and animal products , for example , results in greater exposure to persistent pollutants like ddt and dioxins and heavy metals than does a plant-based diet because these compounds bioaccumulate up the food chain . ” plants are at the bottom of the food chain . the sample of california kids , however , was not eating a plant-based diet . cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all 364 children for arsenic , the banned pesticide dieldrin , a metabolite of ddt called dde , and dioxins . children exceeded safety levels by a greater margin than adults . this is especially of concern for children because all of these compounds are suspected endocrine disruptors and thus may impact normal development . cancer risk ratios were exceeded by over a factor of 100 for both arsenic and dioxins . which foods were the worst ? for preschoolers , the number one food source of arsenic was poultry , though for their parents , it was tuna . the number one source of lead was dairy , and for mercury it was seafood . and the number one source of the banned pesticides and dioxins was dairy . ( see preventing parkinson ’ s disease with diet . ) the researchers also recommended children should eat lower quantities of chips , cereal , crackers , and other crispy carbs to reduce acrylamide intake . the california study didn ’ t split up the groups by gender , but a similar study in europe found that men had higher levels of some of these pollutants than women . for example , levels of the banned pesticide chlordane were higher in men , but women who never breastfed were right up there alongside men , with the lowest levels found in women who breastfed over 12 months . therefore , it is likely that the lactation-related reduction in blood pollutant levels partly explains the lower body burdens among women compared with men . so cows can lower their levels by giving some to us , then we can pass it along to our children . what non-cancer effects might some of these pollutants have ? they can affect our immune system . studies clearly demonstrate the “ ability of dioxins and related compounds to have a long-lasting and deleterious impact on immune function . ” this manifests as increased incidences of respiratory infections , ear infections , cough , and sore throat . at first , most of the data was for during infancy , but now we have follow-up studies showing that the immunosuppressive effects of these toxins may persist into early childhood , so we should try to reduce our exposure as much as possible . because these pollutants accumulate in animal fat , consuming a plant-based diet – decreasing meat , dairy , and fish consumption – may reduce exposure for children and adults alike . these findings should come as no surprise to those who saw my video pollutants in california breast tissue . for an overview see cdc report on environmental chemical exposure and president ’ s cancer panel report on environmental risk . pollutant exposure may affect the ability to have children in the first place ( male fertility and diet and meat hormones & female infertility ) . such a delay , though , may allow one an opportunity to reduce one ’ s toxic burden through dietary change ( hair testing for mercury before considering pregnancy and how long to detox from fish before pregnancy ? ) . during pregnancy , pollutants can be transferred directly ( ddt in umbilical cord blood ) , and after pregnancy through breastfeeding ( the wrong way to detox ) . once our kids are contaminated , how fast can children detoxify from pcbs ? the chemicals have implications for older children too : protein , puberty , and pollutants . seafood is not the only source of toxic heavy metals . see : videos on primary food sources of other industrial pollutants include : there are some things we can eat , though , to counteract some of the toxins : ​ this blog reminds me of pcbs found in children ’ s fish oil and how algae-based omega 3 supplements may be much less risky.i may have missed it but has dr. gregor addressed the evils of vaccinations , a barbaric practice that directly injects contaminants into the infant or child ’ s bloodstream . it can ’ t get more directly poisoning than that.vaccination is one of the greatest public health triumphs in the history of humanity , not the lest of which for eliminating smallpox , which used to kill hundreds of millions of people.you ’ re just regurgitating what you ’ ve been taught but as one of my professors once said , “ what ’ s the use of knowing so much if what you know ain ’ t so ? ” so called smallpox is a body initiated and conducted process of elimination through the skin from excessive toxemia . as with any body elimination process , once this process has run it ’ s course , the patient always recovers . it ’ s the ones where there ’ s medical intervention , i.e. vaccines , etc. that die . the causes are cumulative emotional , physical and chemical stressors from dietary , environmental and lifestyle factors . “ doctor ” that is perhaps the most idiotic thing i ’ ve read in disqus.in the 60 ’ s millions a year worldwide died from smallpox . the world health org joined by dozens of other volunteer , charitable , health orgs and governments around the world launched a program to eradicate the disease . it took over a decade . the whole world , tv , newspapers , magazine media watched and documented a massive global vaccination program that encircled and extinguished outbreaks till in 1980 the disease was completely wiped off the planet.trying to rewrite that or deny that is like trying to deny that wwii happened . you sir are delusional. http : / / www.pbs.org / wgbh / aso / databank / entries / dm79sp.html http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 6293036 http : / / www.sciencemag.org / content / 196 / 4296 / 1298.short http : / / science.nationalgeographic.com / science / health-and-human-body / human-diseases / smallpox-article / https : / / web.stanford.edu / group / virus / pox / history.html # eradication http : / / ije.oxfordjournals.org / content / 1 / 1 / 25.abstractwait for it , there ’ s going to be some response about ddt ( or some other chemical ) or something like “ germs aren ’ t real , they are made up by big pharma to sell their products ” .no , bacteria are very real and they are also present when dis ease processes are made necessary but they are not causative . we have hundreds of billions of micro organisms in and on us . if they caused health complications , humans would not even exists.wrong , wrong wrong . there are pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms . some are symbiotic , some are parasitic . you live in a dreamland.wow , he comes from the land of friendly parasites and non-pathogenic microorganisms . i need to get some of what that dr is smokin ’ who knew if you just didn ’ t have any toxemia / contamination you could have avoided smallpox ?

? ? i ’ m not in denial about any of this . what i am is correctly educated as to what dis ease is , what purpose these physiological processes serve and what makes them necessary . and also that there ’ s no such thing as vaccine . it ’ s just a concept like the moon is made out of cheese is a concept but obviously it has on validity , neither does so called vaccine . the human body can only use a limited number of substances and the ingredients in so called vaccines , ( embalming fluid , razor sharp micro slivers of aluminum , msg , polysorbate 80 , mercury derivatives , macerated putrefied monkey kidneys , etc . ) , are definitely not on the list . they belong in the witch ’ s cauldron straight out of “ macbeth ” . if you don ’ t think such a caustic chemical soup injected directly into the body – no chance to be partially neutralized by the digestive system – damages healthy cells and cellular function or even can kill the entire organism , you ’ re certifiably imbecilic . perhaps you should make your own “ cocktail ” of the above “ vaccine ” ingredients and down a glass full and see how that works for you . it will probably make your completely immune to everything for eternity as i ’ ve seen other morons do who were medically tricked by “ experts ” like yourself into believing they caught something and took “ medicine ” and it cured them alright … they all died ! again i ask are you denying the eradication of smallpox took place ? there it is … something even more laughably ignorant than your other post .. doctor … what a joke.there it is … a post more laughably ignorant than your first post … doctor … what a joke.and you dodged the question.blah blah blah … i ’ m sure your imaginary patients feel extremely lucky they found you . do they give you a link to a colorful printable diploma once you ’ ve “ passed ” that extensive study ? troll … delusional faker.nope , i ’ m correct . you have been medically brainwashed but you wouldn ’ t know that because if you knew you were brainwashed you wouldn ’ t be brainwashed but you are – irreversibly brainwashed . you ’ ve only studied wrong information that is promulgated by medical interests which definitely include cdc , who , nih , etcetera so that they can “ save the day ” with their lab synthesized chemicals and make billions . medicine ’ s top priority is to make sure the public never suspects that the on going complications people experience are from their underlying illness and not from the “ medicines ” but that ’ s slowly changing as more and more people wake up to the delusion of so called medicine . you haven ’ t found the correct information yet , keep searching . as always , health is only produced by healthful living and not from drugging people , duh … and the 12 year vaccination campaign that the entire world witnessed as the scourge was eradicated at the cost of millions to the governments and entities .. that provided the doctors and nurses and aide workers and vaccines ( manufactured and contributed by the russians mostly ) .. that went at their own peril into disease ridden 3rd world hot spots .. the millions that died .. that was all what ? a dream .. an elaborate hoax ? it happened .. the whole world watched and participated .. it ’ s not a matter of being misinformed moron . you are in some kind of deep grand delusion if you think you can spin smallpox away with germ theory denialist bs . duh … dr. greger , i believe it is very important that you do a video segment on “ the vegan diet ” which you talk about so much . people need to know many things all at once , in one video : such as how there are many canned foods that are extremely high in salt ; soluble and insoluble fats , vitamins , and fibers ; electrolytes ( especially important for developing teens who get dead arms while sleeping / sitting ) ; steamed vs raw for absorption ; probably juicing too ; celtic sea salt ( for electrolytes ) ; and i could probably think of a few other things too but there are things new vegans need to know before they switch or there could be serious problems that arise … it needs to be done.thanks doc . love the info and the vids.hey robert . i appreciate the suggestion . we do not promote a particular “ diet ” so a video on vegan diets would not be appropriate . i can send you loads of resources to organizations who promote vegan diets and have menu plans and recipe options . for those following a vegan diet or looking to transition i love dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations . of course , as you point out , he covers many research studies conducted on vegan diets or populations who follow a vegetarian or even a more plant-based type of diet . i am happy to help answer any questions you have about a healthful vegan diet . maybe i can write a post about what consists of a healthful vegan diet ? if that is something our site visitors would like i ’ ll ask dr. greger if i can post something in my ask the dietitian section under “ nutrition questions ” thanks again for your thoughts , josephthis is a great blog post . thanks for writing it . i often read the abstracts you refer to . i read the california one and the abstract also implicated vegetables and fruit with heavy metal contamination , right up there with dairy . i am assuming the actual article ( not the abstract ) went into more detail and showed tuna , poultry and the other animal foods you mention are higher risk factors . or was it more a leap of faith / understanding that the higher up the food chain you go , the worse it gets ? i just want to be certain i ’ m passing on reliable information to people , and not just reading with a ‘ vegan is best ’ slant.hi mec . thanks for utilizing the abstracts . i wouldn ’ t assume anything ! it ’ s always great to double check to make sure dr. greger and myself are reporting the study findings correctly . we are pretty quick to fix any errors , so please , if you ever see anything “ off ” just ask . are you referring to fig . 3 in that study ? you are right it seems that the selected fruits and vegetables mentioned in the abstract contributed to pesticide exposure . the good news is that finding organic options essentially eliminates this concern . plus , eating organic may be healthier and safer . let me know if this helps . thanks again for your comments.thanks for your fast reply . i was able to read the whole article ( linked to the video referred to in this article ) and it did make it clear that the more animal foods we eat , the more contamination . that ’ s what the actual researchers said . then in the breakdown they pointed out repeatedly the fact that various plant foods also added to the heavy metal risk . i have always found dr gregor ’ s articles and videos reliable information , and am glad to say this has also proven to be the case.i think as vegans , it becomes a habit of ‘ putting down ’ animal foods , but forgetting to mention that we need to aim for nutritional excellence in plant foods also . in fact , even though i had read often about heterocyclic amines in cooked meat , i had heard nothing about acrylamides until this week when i both studied it in my nutrition degree as well as read this article on dr gregor ’ s website . vegans are always baking vegetables , grilling vegetables , stir-frying vegetables in water till they ‘ caramelise ’ ( or should i say ‘ acrylamidise ’ ) , baking vegan type cakes and cookies – and no one says a thing about the carcinogens caused by these cooking methods . maybe this is why vegans also get cancer , despite meat avoidance . it might be time to bring this to light , for the good of the whole vegan community.joseph , do you know if it ’ s true or not that lacto fermenting veggies can break down pesticides and certain pollutants , as i ’ ve read in many separate places that say also it reduces the need to buy everything organic , which i just can ’ t afford to do , ( so am progressively growing more of my own . ) not everyone provides the studies like you do here ! if only ! thanks ! hi charzie . i ’ m not familiar with any research . if you find any links post them ! i think organics are preferred , but please don ’ t let that stop you from eating whole foods ! often finances keep us from buying the most healthful items in the market , but we still have to eat . the benefits of eating conventional veggies outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure . i agree that if you have the space growing your own is preferred.hey charzie , organic is an expensive premium product like fancy cigars and expensive brandy , so save your money and eat more conventional fruits and veggies , you will be far more healthy in the long run and you might even have a bit of extra coin in your pocket to treat yourself to some fancy chocolate or a night out . best wishesmercola says lacto fermenting works , so it surely must.what the hell is lacto fermenting ? will it make my pizza taste better ? think kimchi and sauerkraut . i don ’ t think those things would make pizza better , rather the opposite.canadian bacon and sauerkraut pizza . sounds gross , but it ’ s delicious.i ’ m going with gross on that one , mostly because i find sauerkraut repulsive.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

14	blood type diet perceived as " crass fraud " it was adolf hitler who coined a propaganda technique he called , “ the big lie , ” arguing that people may be more likely to believe colossal untruths , because they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously , so in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility . dr. peter d ’ adamo ’ s book eat right for your type makes the astounding claim that people with different blood types should eat different foods . type o ’ s , for example , are supposed to be like the hunter and eat a lot of meat , whereas type a ’ s are supposed to eat less . a 2013 systematic review of the evidence supporting blood type diets was published in one of the world ’ s most prestigious nutrition journals . the researchers didn ’ t find any . the researchers sifted through over a thousand papers that might shed some light on the issue , and none of the studies showed an association between blood type diets and health-related outcomes . they conclude that “ there is currently no evidence that an adherence to blood type diets will provide health benefits , despite the substantial presence and perseverance of blood type diets within the health industry . ” ten years earlier , the journal of the norwegian medical association released a number of papers that came out of a day-long scientific seminar held by the norwegian society for nutrition . 40,000 copies of the eat right for your type had been sold in norway , and so the researchers sought to determine whether blood type diets were visionary science or nonsense . they also concluded that they are nonsense . the author of the blood type diet book responded to the review on his website , saying that “ there is good science behind the blood type diet , just like there was good science behind einstein ’ s mathematical calculations . ” he says that if blood type diets were just tested in the right way , like einstein ’ s e = mc2 , he would be vindicated . the reason we don ’ t see any studies on blood types and nutrition , he complains , is “ because of little interest and available money . ” but he ’ s sold more than seven million books . why doesn ’ t he fund his own studies ? that ’ s what the atkins corporation did . in fact , he has ! in 1996 , he wrote , “ i am beginning the eighth year of a ten year trial on reproductive cancers , using the blood type diets … by the time i release the results in another 2 years , i expect to make it scientifically demonstrable that the blood type diet plays a role in cancer remission . ” ok , so that would be 1998 . the results ? still not released , sixteen years later . good tactic , though , saying you ’ re just about to publish a study and banking that nobody would actually follow up . so in his sequel , he said he was currently conducting a “ twelve-week randomized , double-blind , controlled trial implementing the blood type diet , to determine its effects on the outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis . ” ( see my video blood type diet debunked ) . that was ten years ago . as my norwegian colleague bemoaned , “ it is difficult not to perceive the whole thing as a crass fraud . ” so rarely are popular press diet books afforded such fact-checking . kudos to these researchers . if only we had this 13 years ago when the book was on the bestseller list ! i have a few videos on popular diets , such as : i also wrote a book about low-carb diets , which is now available free online full-text at atkinsfacts.org. unfortunately , nutrition illiteracy is not just a problem among the public , but among the medical profession : it is unfortunate that these fad diet books can get published with no legitimate research to validate the recommendations ! it just adds to the confusion and gives the people who are resistant to change a crutch.i would say that most people aren ’ t “ resistant to change ” but , when looking for change , are lured by the latest publicized offerings . so many folks have no idea how to critique a new fad ; they go with what the ads say or what dr. oz says or some worker in a health food store hands them.these things always bring to mind the wonderful adage “ people like to hear good news about their bad habits ” jaja .. my philosophy is “ i am real now ” … started becoming real … i became a pescatarian … and i can not kill any fish anymore … therefore , i am vegan ! [ live & learn ] https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 4kezlwdyajkthe problem with the blood type diet is that it assumes that there is something about the blood type that determines everything else about the person.i don ’ t fault the guy for writing the book . i fault everyone else for not doing any critical thinking about the matter . “ i don ’ t fault the guy for writing the book . ” ? ? ? you don ’ t fault someone for spreading bad information that is not backed by science ? “ i fault everyone else for not doing any critical thinking about the matter . ” so why does the author not get the same judgement ? he believed what is not true which means that it is clear that research was either lacking or non-existent for the book.because it is standard operating procedure for people to have ideas that they think have value and for other people to test those ideas.standard operating procedure ? um k.pretty lazy response that appears as though you are trying to sound smart.science works via someone proposing and someone else testing . sorry if i sound smart.dude , you are expecting readers of a book to research what a book says and then challenge the authors . you are implying that when people read books that they should take a scientific approach to it.it is not reasonable that anything beyond a small minority of people do this . i do and i am sure you do . but i would never project that onto others . there is some assumptions that are made , although often incorrectly , that a book that is filled with apparent facts ( though the blood type diet is clearly misleading ) is well researched . how much time do you think people are supposed to have outside of everyday life and then you want to add they have to research everything that they read ? so the expectation is that people use some “ standard operating procedure ” that i have never heard of so i would love to see where you get the idea that what you think is posted somewhere for all to see or taught or whatever the access to this process is so free and well known . if people ran their lives like this one could never get through a ba or bs in four years ; an ma or ms in five to six , and forget a phd . you ’ d be spending time challenging everything you encountered . you have to have some assumptions that people with credentials , in the blood type diet ’ s case the dude was a homeopath but you also have people like dr. peter j. d ’ adamo who are also behind the btd . with homeopathy and also a medical doctor that ends up being more than enough for people.i guess that the world should stop so we can constantly question what we think we know and what we are told rather than putting a little faith that sometimes what we are told is accurate . with the btd , i never bought into it but i can see some people did . there are doctors involved in the diet , studies that make claims that some readers have no idea how to debunk and not everyone has the tool set to even full absorb what a study would be telling them through the data.again , how do you still blame the people that read the book rather than those who wrote it ? shouldn ’ t the author of the book and the people behind the diet be held to the same standard ? clearly they either 1 ) didn ’ t follow the standard operational procedure or 2 ) understand the research that they did or 3 ) intentionally lied . yet it is the people that follow the diet who are at fault for not challenging or taking time to research and refute a diet that has some medical professionals behind it.i also didn ’ t say you sound smart . i said that it appears that you are trying to sound smart.i read books all the time and then experiment on myself . those people who read his book could easily have done the same thing . they could also have read counter ideas and noticed that the theory was full of holes.it works by someone proposing ( and generally with some evidence to back it up ) a hypothesis in a scientific journal or at a scientific conference . the subsequent testing is then done partially by the original proposer and partially by their well-qualified colleagues . that is fundamentally different from putting something out to what amounts to a popular vote by laypeople who generally have neither the training nor the resources to meaningfully validate the claims.there is no law saying that someone can ’ t publish a book . but the theory in the book should be tested by others , including individuals . the peer review process does not work very well for paradigm shifting ideas . alfred wegener had a very negative peer review for 50 years until pictures by the us navy of the floor of the atlantic ocean proved that the continents actually did drift . i know that the official peer review process is supposed to work a certain way , all unbiased and such , but that is not how it works in practice.i ’ m not sure where the law thing came from ; no one claimed that it was illegal for the book to be published.again , the vast majority of the target audience have neither the means nor the wherewithal to test the hypothesis presented in the book ( which , incidentally , doesn ’ t present it as a hypothesis but with assertion of fact – a very unscientific thing to do ) . i don ’ t know about you , but i certainly don ’ t have a handy lab at home where i can do my blood work every day to validate the claims in any such book.as you seem to be having a hard time understanding this , let me provide an analogy : if i say to a co-worker , “ the program i just wrote is going to take over all your gadgets and extract your soul for tormenting , unless you do x ” , they ’ ll know i ’ m just kidding ( and what ’ s more , they ’ ll have the expertise to trivially prove that i ’ m talking rubbish ) ; if i say the same thing to my child , then not only will they not be able to prove my claim wrong , but they ’ ll believe me because of my status in our relationship ( d ’ adamo ’ s “ dr ” and “ naturopathic physician ” confers similar status at first glance , in many people ’ s eyes ) . in the case of the child , i ’ m certainly the evildoer and the child the innocent victim.hth “ the vast majority of the target audience have neither the means nor the wherewithal to test the hypothesis presented in the book ” i don ’ t get it . every single reader has the means to test the hypothesis . all that they need to do is try it . then , if they are still unsure , they can try one or all of the other blood-type diets to see what happens . does the rash go away ? does the insomnia go away ? we don ’ t need very expensive ivory tower institutions to test things . we can and should test them ourselves.um , wut ? oh , right : the placebo effect doesn ’ t exist , right ? see , if i believe strongly enough that a given thing ( be it medicine or lifestyle change ) that i believe i ’ m adopting will have a certain effect , then there ’ s a high likelihood that this effect ensues , whether or not i ’ m actually really adopting that thing . this is why you need to a ) measure objectively , b ) not know whether or not you ’ re adopting it , and c ) be able to compare outcomes between applying the thing and not ( i.e. , the control ) . experimenting on yourself without access to a lab makes ( a ) impossible , and ( b ) and ( c ) very hard ( and impossible without help ) .but maybe you have access to a helper and a lab , in which case you ’ re just making an error of entitlement , so let me assure you : the vast majority of people who have access to d ’ adamo ’ s books , don ’ t have access to your enormous resources . i hope that ’ s clarified things for you.of course the placebo effect exists , but it doesn ’ t require $ multimillion experiments to get around it . one first has to be aware of it . that is the first big step . and people must understand that if they let it influence their judgement that they will be paying for garbage that they don ’ t really need.most of my diy healing compatriots are not even aware of it ’ s existence . too bad . most skeptopaths think that it is an insurmountable problem that can only be gotten around with $ multimillion experiments , the experiments that only pharmaceutical companies can afford . this is simply not true.a ) i didn ’ t say $ multimillion . even a few thousand per year would be too much for me , and sufficient lab visits + helper to at least single-blind the experiment would cost at least that.b ) regarding ability to consciously counteract the placebo effect : [ citation needed ] .b ) me.i think that it probably only works with people who have been practising absolute honestly for decades . it changes one ’ s character . i can ’ t be sure , because i do not know nor can i imagine any other way to be.wait , so you ’ re saying that because , based on your ( by definition ) subjective opinion you were able to consciously counteract the placebo effect , everyone can ? that ’ s an even bolder statement.but back to your original claim , blaming the victims : i ’ ve got a hypothesis ( don ’ t worry ; i researched it as well as d ’ adamo researched his claim ) that if you stand in front of a large microwave antenna while it ’ s active for 10 minutes per day , you will disease-proof yourself . i believe it is now your responsibility ( oops , i meant “ standard operating procedure ” ) to test it out . ( everyone else reading : please don ’ t test this out . or engage in victim-blaming . ) actually , i didn ’ t say that . i said that perhaps most people couldn ’ t do it because they don ’ t practice absolute honesty . most people can easily fool themselves because they spend so much time lying to everyone else . this would probably include you.thanks for keeping the conversation civil ! i responded about the placebo effect above if interested . appreciate your opinions and ability to have a conversation even if there is disagreement.thanks for keeping the conversation civil ! i responded about the placebo effect above . good points.joseph , i couldn ’ t find your comment.um , wut ? oh , right : the placebo effect doesn ’ t exist , right ? see , if i believe strongly enough that a given thing ( be it medicine or lifestyle change ) that i believe i ’ m adopting will have a certain effect , then there ’ s a high likelihood that this effect ensues , whether or not i ’ m actually really adopting that thing . this is why you need to a ) measure objectively , b ) not know whether or not you ’ re adopting it , and c ) be able to compare outcomes between applying the thing and not ( i.e. , the control ) . experimenting on yourself without access to a lab makes ( a ) impossible , and ( b ) and ( c ) very hard ( and impossible without help ) .but maybe you have access to a helper and a lab , in which case you ’ re just making an error of entitlement , so let me assure you : the vast majority of people who have access to d ’ adamo ’ s books , don ’ t have access to your enormous resources . i hope that ’ s clarified things for you . “ there is no law saying that someone can ’ t publish a book ” you seem to lack the ability to focus. that was never in question . “ but the theory in the book should be tested by others , including individuals ” and like many things , it was and has the backing of qualified people , that doesn ’ t make it right of course . “ alfred wegener had a very negative peer review for 50 years until pictures by the us navy of the floor of the atlantic ocean proved that the continents actually did drift ” ok but that is not what we are talking about . all that does is prove that you are wrong . you see , anyone who would have investigated what we knew about plate tectonics back in the day would have come to the conclusion that the idea at the time was right and that wegener was wrong . thus , anyone who did their research would have also come to the wrong conclusion . just change plate tectonics and continental drift to the blood type diet . perhaps some readers did research and ran into the data that seemed to support it . tie that into the idea that it is ok to rely on experts … except for you who probably googles anything that your doctor tells you . “ i know that the official peer review process is supposed to work a certain way ” more lack of focus . we were never talking about peer reviewed papers . you were blaming the readers of the book and not fellow experts in related fields.oi. nice tap dance attempt.and all of those people are wrong . they castigated wegener for 50 years . wegener ’ s evidence is still used today to support the theory of continental drift . there was nothing wrong with his evidence . it was perhaps not sufficient to convince everyone , but that does not make them right and him wrong . it just makes them lacking in imagination and the courage to look outside of the box.my point is not that the people were wrong . my point is that at the time most of the science was that the evidence for plate tectonics was not there , thus if someone did their own research back then and came to the same conclusion as the science of the time they would still have been wrong even when they used your bullshit argument of following “ standard operating procedure ” .your inability to focus is astounding . i am going to assume that you know your first bs was wrong so you now keep trying to target other things . why can ’ t people like you ever just say “ yeah , maybe i was wrong ” or “ i should have worded it like xyz since i am clearly being misunderstood . instead you argue your bs to the end even when it is obvious that the authors , which you hold blameless , are the ones that should have done more work in this topic and not the readers . there are times in life that one has to rely on experts and assume that the data is solid . obviously this does not mean that experts are always right but you cannot expect everyone to live the life of a cynic.did you ever consider that maybe some of these folks used your method of validating the book ? self testing ? not that anecdotal evidence is proof of anything . “ evidence for plate tectonics was not there ” the evidence was there . just not enough to convince uptight people trying to defend their turf.did wegener publish a paper or a popsci book to present his hypothesis ? erich von däniken went the popsci book route.erich von daniken ’ s theory cannot be proven nor disproven until such time as ufos are proven or disproven ( sort of an impossibility , logically speaking . ) so , for me , von daniken ’ s theory is merely hot air . wegener ’ s theory has been confirmed so many times that it is no longed doubted by anyone.what was your point again ? the point was the venue chosen by wegener to present his hypothesis to be tested ? in a respected peer-reviewed journal or in the court of public opinion ( popsci book 4 layppl ) ? ? i have no idea what venue wegener used . i do know that for paradigm shifting discoveries , the peer review process is flawed.not sure why mjs responded so negatively , i totally get what you are saying and the fact that it is succinct has little to do with laziness.thank you , crystal . yes , insightfulness usually comes in very short sentences . arnold : “ i ’ ll be back ” . leonidas the spartan : “ then we will fight in the shade . ” jesus : “ whatsoever you would have others do to you , do also to them . ” . descartes : “ i think , therefore i am ” . bachcole : “ i experience , therefore i am ” . mcarthur : “ i

? what about the ayurvedic body type diet , promoted by the likes of dr. chopra and dr. oz ? http : / / www.doctoroz.com / article / ayurvedic-diet-how-eat-your-body-typei am not as familiar with ayurvedic diets , but from what i gather there is far more research than this “ blood type diet ” not to mention ayurveda is an ancient indian practice . i would be very weary of some ayurvedic medicines due to metals . i don ’ t think there is one “ diet ” and western practitioners are definitely not as familiar with the 3 doshas and what constitutes a healthful diet . also , yoga , meditation , etc . , are all part of the healing process in ayurveda , as lifestyle and diet are not separate . i hope others can weigh-in here . i ’ ll post more links and references as i find them . thanks for bringing up this topic . “ very weary [ sic ] of some ” the error ( feels like automatic spelling “ correction ” ) may not be obvious to all : leeryfixed ! thanks , yes sometimes i go too fast thx for catching that ! what about genotype diets . is there some truth to thatgreat question . yes . there is research to support that those with genetic variants may need altered diets . genetic and metabolic determinants of human epigenetic variation is one abstract i found on the subject.the idea that an individual ideal diet varies from person to person is valid given the immense variability in the human genome and thus phenotypes . the biomarker this author chose to identify genotypes and diet relationship does not appear valid but the concept does . we just have to move on and explore more predictive biomarkers.exactly. the more we know , the more we know how little we know . blood type may be a small pixel in the much larger picture.truth tellers convey the facts , with measured caution . liars know the facts , but willfully mislead . bullshitters just make up any story to impress the people that pay money or take the time to listen to them.i think there is some research about people with type a blood having less stomach acid . maybe they shouldn ’ t eat so much meat.any doctor trying to heal , tries his best , and has nothing to do with hitler , who was killing , not healing . dr. greger , please read more articles , in particular about works of dr. william donald kelley , who established the basics of some protocols in medicine , which work in curing cancer ! ! just go to http : / / www.dr-gonzalez.com / history _ of _ treatment.htm and educate yourself , on how blood type can and do affect our immune system , our digestion and consequently the healing.thanks for the link ! i think dr. greger was just referring to the fact this so-called “ blood type diet ” has been scientifically reviewed and it does not appear to hold any credibility . it ’ s a huge lie and folks should know about it ! if anyone still wants to buy the book are try the diet i have no objections ( we ’ re all adults and we make our own choices ) , but as a dietitian i would never recommend it . this reminds me of the gerson diet , where studies also do not appear to hold credibility for its use.i am one of the thousands who purchased the book some years ago after seeing a tight correlation between the type o list and my own experience . i agree that the so-called science behind the blood type diet is a made up . but i think what dr. d ’ adamo tried to do was come up with a scientific sounding theory to back up what he saw happening in people . i have ibs and am gluten intolerant . and seeing his list for type os for the first time , i immediately knew that there was something to it , as it agreed almost 100 % with my own experience . but i know other people that are type o that have normal digestive systems that would totally laugh at the type o list as being totally irrelevant to them personally . as the type-o diet would suggest , eating meat does make my stomach feel better . but having moved to a fodmap free , plant based diet has worked wonders for me . now at age 60 i am in better health than i have been in years ! good points . yes , and like 50 % of folks are type o so there would be some huge variations.following the blood type diet – with a few exceptions – led to big improvements in health for me . i do not think this guy who came up with this has a bad or evil or selfish motivation . i think his intentions are good . and even if they were not , lots of people claim to have greatly benefited from following the blood type diet.understood , but if folks have greatly benefited there is still no research to support whether or not the benefits were due to the “ diet ” or just random , like a placebo effect . look , i am all for people feeling better so that ’ s good to hear something worked for you , but selling 7 million copies of a book with no science raises questions for medical and health professionals . i am unsure his intentions i think what matters is the research.that is a very flawed study in that “ gerson ” video . actually they did not follow the gerson protocol in the study so dr. greger using the gerson name in the video is misleading . disappointing to say the least.i know about that one too … gonzalez ’ protocols are based on a combination of dr kelley and gerson . i think anyone familiar with gonzalez might not be so quick to dismiss the claims made by this author and it should be remembered that a lot of great scientists ( not saying i think this blood type author will be one of them ) , have made some wrong conclusions , but have also contributed a lot . i just don ’ t know if villifying this author is completely justified as of yet … as much as i support the notion that anything other than plant based foods are merely optional or necessary when there is no other option.however , we must remember : absence of proof does not mean proof of absence . just because we don ’ t find any proof of the blood-type association , it does not mean there is no such an association.yes , would be nice if you made a piece about ayurvedic eating and how much science there is to it.noted ! thanks . please see my comment below as someone also asked about ayurvedic diets.all ‘ modern medicine ’ md ’ s , r.d. , etc , please watch : “ the truth about cancer ” by ty bollinger , and please inform yourself on real studies.i recall hearing mr. bollinger pushing something called “ cancer , step out of the box ” on the sort of radio station on which you might also hear ads for gold coins , survival foods , male-enhancement pills and whatnot.mr. / mrs. kylemeister , please read carefully , bollinger ’ s documentaries are about cancer and their title is , i ’ m repeating once again , in case you have trouble reading “ the truth about cancer ” . you can watch and listen to some of these series ( 11 altogether ) on youtube , which to my knowledge is not a radio … maybe there should an age limit for giving the comments here … call me crazy , but i ’ m thinking his book ( granted , i didn ’ t get the title exactly right ) is probably basically similar to his youtube videos . this accountant / ” cancer researcher ” appears to me to be a pseudoscience / conspiracy-theory crank who associates with others of that sort.i just want to add that i think ty bollinger is genuinely on a mission to find a different solution than chemo / radiation to the cancer equation after losing his parents and many family members to it . he may not be “ qualified ” as a actual researcher , but strong passion that drives us can be very powerful motivator and agent of change , which is desperately needed in this area . i don ’ t think he has all the pieces for sure , and maybe even some questionable ones , but he is trying hard to reframe the puzzle , which is more than standard medicine is doing by continuing to perpetuate the same “ nuke ‘ em all and check for survivors ” approach , and nary a word about diet , prevention , or alternatives . i learned a lot from the series he put together , even if i thought some of his “ experts ” were less than stellar and missing some key issues … like a non animal based diet for starters ! ( but i also believe that each of us are the culmination of our ancestry , and just because i can ’ t handle any animal products for several reasons , doesn ’ t mean others may not have more leeway . ) i firmly believe that plants heal and and about everything else is questionable , but our tolerance and the consequences vary … which is probably true about everything in our individual lives . anyway , i definitely would not classify mr bollinger as a dangerous / distracting conspiracy theory crank , but a man on a hopeful mission who is reframing the outmoded attitudes and questionable practices of current treatments that have depressing overall “ cure ” rates , debilitating effects , and potential to cause the very disease it is trying to alleviate , and focusing on increasing the body ’ s natural ability to heal and maintain a disease free state . though i know we need weapons to win a war , i also know that not having to start a war in the first place is the best answer to the conundrum . only opinion , but i feel that his “ quest for the cure ” series has the potential to at least stimulate curiosity and help forward needed dialogue for other possible solutions , besides the obviously inadequate ones currently entrenched as dogma.a fool and their money are easily parted . who buys these books , where are the facts , where is the evidence ? these people think empirical has something to do with royalty .haven ’ t read the book , so don ’ t know anything about the blood-type diet . but thinking that one diet is the right way of eating for all seven-billion + humans in the planet doesn ’ t make sense to me . look how different all of us are in many ways . if superficial differences are not important , look how differently we react to external stimuli , like food , in immediately measurable ways ? for example , some people can eat half a pound of beans everyday without any problem ; others can ’ t eat an ounce occasionally without developing gas problems.i would tend to agree . i think the bean and gas connection is interesting and folks don ’ t give beans enough credit . i mean the science on beans is there , so i see very good reason to incorporate more beans into the diet . of course , if they “ tear you up ” even with an ounce avoid them like the plague , but i have seen little research to support this . no doubt i ’ ve heard folks mention it anecdotally and i ’ d never tell someone to eat something that causes bloat and pain , it ’ s just that i ’ ve found most folks can tolerate beans in the end.totally agree and in my experience , most people who expect beans to cause them problems , experience them ! i know because i was one of them ! lol ! it ’ s amazing how when you change your perspective , everything follows suit ! i love beans now , but that is just a tiny example … changing my diet changed my entire life , and even though i am certainly getting older , ( a good thing now ! ) it just keeps getting better ! thank you nutrition facts / dr gregor , you rock ! dr. g. talked about the blood type diet over a year ago. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / blood-type-diet-debunked / as a type o + , i was happy to hear it was debunked . i love me my peanut butter . and cinnamon … .and avocados … .and … . : - ) talking about diet . is there a place i can go to to see if my plant based diet is proportionally correct ? try cronometer . they have an app and a website . you enter your food in and it will give you all the info you need.thank you , i looked at cronometer and , if i can be honest here i am an impulsive emotional eater and if i have to count a calorie i am afraid it has already been eaten and to late to consider its fate . for my purposes i am thinking categories like fruits , whole grains , beans , greens , vegetables. so if i eat a cup of fruit , 3 cups of cooked grains in their whole form , 3 cups of cooked beans , and 4 cups of cooked greens and miscellaneous raw vegetables a day is that an optimum plant based diet if it meets my caloric needs ? if i need to cut calories out what should be the first portion to reduce in size ? good job ! as the famous quote goes , ” it ’ s not what we don ’ t know that hurts us … it ’ s what we ‘ know ’ that just ain ’ t so ! ! his associates are medical doctors , with a difference approach to heal . most of them educated themselves about nutrition , in contrary to any ‘ conventional ’ m.d , who knows next to nothing about it . examples of these doctors : b. weeks , m.d , stanislaw burzynski , m.d , phd , l.e. connealy m.d , b , johnso
15	why do heart doctors favor surgery and drugs over diet ? when he was a surgeon at the cleveland clinic , dr. caldwell esselstyn jr. published a controversial paper in the american journal of cardiology , highlighted in my video , fully consensual heart disease treatment , noting that heart bypass operations carry significant risks including the potential to cause further heart damage , stroke , and brain dysfunction . angioplasty isn ’ t much better , also carrying significant mortality and morbidity , and often doesn ’ t work ( in terms of decreasing the risk of subsequent heart attack or death ) . “ so , ” he writes , “ it seems we have an enormous paradox . the disease that is the leading killer of men and women in western civilization is largely untreated . ” the benefits of bypass surgery and angioplasty “ are at best temporary and erode over time , with most patients eventually succumbing to their disease . ” in cancer management , we call that palliative care , where we just kind of throw up our hands , throw in the towel , and give up actually trying to treat the disease . why does this juggernaut of invasive procedures persist ? well one reason he suggests is that performing surgical interventions has the potential for enormous financial reward . conversely , lack of adequate return is considered one of the barriers to the practice of preventive cardiology . diet and lifestyle interventions lose money for the physician . another barrier is that doctors don ’ t think patients want it . physician surveys show that doctors often don ’ t even bring up diet and lifestyle options because they assume that patients would prefer to be on cholesterol-lowering drugs every day for the rest of their lives rather than change their eating habits . that may be true for some , but it ’ s up to the patient , not the doctor , to decide . according to the official ama code of medical ethics , physicians are supposed to disclose all relevant medical information to patients . “ the patient ’ s right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an informed choice . the physician ’ s obligation is to present the medical facts accurately to the patient . ” for example , before starting someone at moderate risk on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug , a physician might ideally say something like : “ you should know that for folks in your situation , the number of individuals who must be treated with a statin to prevent one death from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke is generally between 60 and 100 , which means that if i treated 60 people in your situation , 1 would benefit and 59 would not . as these numbers show , it is important for you to know that most of the people who take a statin will not benefit from doing so and , moreover , that statins can have side effects , such as muscle pain , liver damage , and upset stomach , even in people who do not benefit from the medication . i am giving you this information so that you can weigh the risks and benefits of drugs versus diet and then make an informed decision . ” yet , how many physicians have these kinds of frank and open discussions with their patients ? non-disclosure of medical information by doctors — that kind of paternalism is supposed to be a thing of the past . today ’ s physicians are supposed to honor informed consent under all but a very specific set of conditions ( such as the patient is in a coma or it ’ s an emergency ) . however , too many physicians continue to treat their patients as if they were unconscious . at the end of this long roundtable discussion on angioplasty and stents , the editor-in-chief of the american journal of cardiology reminded us of an important fact to place it all in context . atherosclerosis is due to high cholesterol , which is due to poor dietary choices , so if we all existed on a plant-based diet , we would not have even needed this discussion . the lack of nutrition training in medical school is another barrier . see , for example , my videos doctors ’ nutritional ignorance and doctors know less than they think about nutrition . shockingly , mainstream medical associations actively oppose attempts to educate physicians about clinical nutrition . see my 4-part video series : for more on why doctors don ’ t make more dietary prescriptions , see my video the tomato effect , lifestyle medicine : treating the cause of disease , and convincing doctors to embrace lifestyle medicine . heart disease may be a choice . see cavities and coronaries : our choice and one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic . this is horrifying , but not surprising . before i started my mba studies in finance , i worked in the business office of a hospital . part of my job was delivering monthly income statements to the surgeons in our group . “ from your hands to their hands ” i was told. i.e. their income information was more confidential than anything else , certainly far more confidential than any patient information . hospitals are under tremendous pressure to increase revenues . unfortunately , medicine is all about money and not about effective treatment . spend some time in the business office of any hospital and you will be convinced . … also , keep yourself healthy so you can stay out of the hospital as a patient ! agreed . my one visit to the er was the biggest nightmare of my life . they really don ’ t care one bit about you or anyone . it was one of the most inhuman experience of my life . i asked to leave , and they said if i left without the doctor ’ s consent that insurance would not cover it and i would have to pay the full costs myself . so , in other words , to get out you have to pay bail . how is that any different from a prison ? pamela is saying to stay out of the hospital by being health . she isn ’ t saying to avoid the hospital when you are sick . just stay away from for-profit hospitals . it was also probably inhumane , because the nurses were poorly educated , arrogant , and bitter . a lot of nursing schools completely disregard teaching nurses on how to relate to patients.same thing happened to me . i waited 8 hours in the middle of the night to be treated … and was never seen by a doctor . when i said i wanted to leave , they told me i would not be covered by insurance and would be charged up to $ 500 because i was seen by triage ! ! they cleaned my would and put a band aid on it ! $ 500 for a band aid ! this is precisely the reason why the most harmful thing you can do for your health is to go see a doctor . doctor ’ s like dr. greger are extremely rare . so , who do you trust ? i have yet to meet a single local doctor who is anything but a big pharma sponsored drug dealer . it ’ s getting to the point where , if you want to save your health , the most important thing you can do is avoid doctors completely.or perhaps find one ’ s like dr. greger ? i have a list of a few . let me know if you ’ d like more info : - ) thanks , alexanderyes , i would like to see a list , because i have not been able to find a single one in my area . it ’ s not like you can even search for that , my insurance provider does not have ‘ knows plant-based nutrition ’ as a search criteria . they should , though.cool ! see if this list helps , or if in the dc area there is a brand new clinic that opened , the barnard medical center . here is a link for ​ dr. mcdougall ’ s list ​ .joseph i have been counseling patients for over 10 years about nutrition and have been vegan for over 13 years . how do i get on dr. mcdougall ’ s list.i have personally prescribed dr. mcdougall ’ s recipe book more than 100 times in my practice.i practice internal medicine.hey g-man so glad to know you counsel folks about nutrition ! i have no idea how to make the list . sorry about that . i suggest emailing dr. mcdougall or his staff.joseph , i have also been looking for a good doctor here in lehigh fl , ( near ft myers ) . i am so disgusted with the state of medical practice , i don ’ t even know where to turn ! years ago i had a horrible reaction to a drug and ended up in the er . my partner made it clear to them that i had just started taking a new medicine when he noticed i was totally disoriented and confused , ( i have little memory of it ) and the short story is they tested for everything but , including x-rays ! i left there no different than when i arrived and since he couldn ’ t reach my doctor , made the executive decision to stop the drug … which eventually solved the issues . it was a very traumatic experience , all because of a simple uti ! shortly after that , i saw forks over knives , and alarm bells went off … time to make drastic changes , for a lot of reasons ! i had recently been diagnosed with diabetes , so the timing couldn ’ t have been better to try a wfpb diet , ( 30 days was the plan ) and never looked back ! my doctor was amazed at the changes , but was very hesitant to take me off a slew of now unnecessary medications , despite the fact that everything had changed , so i told her that if she didn ’ t , i would do it myself . she was very distant when she found i didn ’ t actually need them , my numbers were great , but her whole manner changed . maybe because she knew i wouldn ’ t have to come back every couple of months for her “ services ” , but i eventually left her practice . i would love to find someone who is nutrition based because i know first hand that it is the vital answer to so many issues ! dr. policy was prescribe something for a symptom , and side effects be damned , and never try to fix or even discover the actual problem , never even considering diet , other than to tell me to lose weight and recommending an atkins type diet ! i honestly feel all the drugs i was taking only contributed to my problems … it seems every time i had an appointment , there was a new pill on the agenda ! now i cannot believe i fell into that black hole , because i feel better than i ever have since making the all important dietary change ! still , it would be great to have a real doctor to trust with my health … that takes our insurance ! seems drugs and procedures are covered , but nutrition isn ’ t ! powerful story thanks for sharing ! any doctors pop-up from mcdougall ’ s list ? pcrm may have more information , too . i suggest contacting their team and the new barnard medical center once open . let me know how else i can help.just saw that , i will check it out , thanks so much ! a couple more links : http : / / www.vegdocs.com / find.html https : / / docs.google.com / spreadsheets / d / 1fe8sdnawkvpxhfptalealzn9zxmhlkdeomgmtoydcu4 / edit # gid = 609419254thanks for the info ! there were a couple not too far from me . i ’ ll have to contact them . thanks ! a question to you joseph : my understanding has been cholesterol is just one of the risk factors of atherosclerosis . there ’ re others , like lack of exercise , smoking , nutrient deficiencies ( example : vit . d ) . am i wrong ? yes , sounds right ! i would say cholesterol is the biggest factor though , as lack of exercise and nutritional deficiencies ( like lack of fiber ) all promote factors that stimulate the build-up of atherosclerotic plaque.these are all covered on this site – inflammation , oxidation , tmao from animal protein , etc … .thanks paul ! here is a link for “ guest ” or anyone if interested . carnitine , choline , cancer and cholesterol : the tmao connection.alexander , do you know any in alabama or georgia ? thanks ! maybe . here is a link for ​ dr. mcdougall ’ s list ​ . type in your zip and see who pops up ! good luck.that link doesn ’ t appear to be working anymore.go to mcdougall ’ s site , hover over “ connect ” , and then click on “ find a health care practitioner ” . it ’ ll take you to the same link , but the page will work ; not sure why.i saw that initially but i changed immediately after it works for me now.no , i ’ m in nj . i know dr. furhman is in nj , but he ’ s pretty far from me and i seriously doubt it would be easy to become his patient , with his busy schedule . there ’ s probably a huge waiting list for him , anyway.your conclusion is so wrong . doctors push drugs , because people demand drugs , and if they don ’ t get drugs they tend to write a bad review of that doctor . this can threaten a doctor ’ s career . in a patient ’ s eyes , the doctor did nothing if they did not prescribe or offer some treatment . doctors are pressured into over-prescribing drugs by lousy and ignorant patients.it is also illegal for a doctor to receive money from a pharmacy . in fact , a pharm rep can ’ t even offer a doctor lunch . whether or not you buy the drug from the store has absolutely no financial impact on the doctor . the worst thing you can do is avoid a doctor when you are sick.hi pamela : this book , written by a surgeon with a conscience , elaborates nicely on what you ’ ve observed : unaccountable by m. makarythanks ! will take a look . “ why . . . ” why else ? nutrition : $ $ surgery : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ ! ! ! ! ! even diseases can be social constructions . for example , people give them names and categorize them from social interactions . if the diseases are discovered or treated by people seeking money , hospitals could become financial institutions . knowledge could potentially save your life and damage their image . but there is a real need for hospitals / doctors like for example trauma.the social construction of illness : key insights and policy implicationshttp : / / hsb.sagepub.com / content / 51 / 1 _ suppl / s67.full.pdf + htmlmoneyi seem to recall reading in “ you : the owner ’ s manual ” by dr ’ s roizen and oz a few years back that most cardiac surgeons take statins in a prophylactic manner for themselves . any cardiac surgeons care to weigh in on that ? keep ‘ em sick , you can fleece money off patients as long as you keep them alive . big bucks for big pharma . not health care , but disease control . if your oil light in your car comes on , unplug the light , is their solution . don ’ t address the cause of disease , just treat the symptoms . too bad medicare won ’ t cover alternate medicine and naturalistic medicine.the only people “ keeping ‘ em sick ” are the patients themselves . doctors would love if you changed your diet , but they know that is not an option , because americans are gluttonous pigs . our culture would rather fix a problem , rather than prevent it . also alternative medicine by definition is medicine that is unproven scientifically , if it actually worked it would be labeled mainstream medicine . at that point you would probably be against it . do not pretend that the alternative medicine industry isn ’ t a multibillion dollar industry just like pharm companies . the difference is that the alt medicine industry is overtly lying to the customer.i ’ ll choose alternate medicine , supplements , and nutrition . feeling a lot better since i dumped the doctors and their poisonest pills.my man had a triple heart bypass in oct 2014 . we started to become vegan in june 2014 . but we were cutting the red meat and going meatless meals for a few years . but now he is on the drugs so he doesn ’ t have another heart attack . but we keep wondering if he should come off of them.but in 2003 he had a heart angina and had for stents . all 4 stents were totally clogged , that is why he had the triple bypass . we went the the heart nutritionist who taught us how to stop the salt and eat more healthy . so we bought organic chicken breast and wild caught pacific salmon and organic yogurt and almond milk and thought we were doing ok . but we think we should keep the drugs up for a while until more blood tests can be takensusad2985 , please watch the first 5 minutes of dr. greger ’ s 2014 annual vid : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / from-table-to-able / ( of course if that grabs you ’ re welcome to watch the rest ! ) store bought almond milk isn ’ t all it ’ s cracked up to be , btw.susad2985 : i hope your guy does very well for many years to come.based on what you wrote , i question how much your nutritionist understands about heart disease . if your man wants to get off drugs , i highly recommend the book : prevent and reverse heart disease by caldwell b. esselstyn . the book is a powerful read , explaining the one diet proven to reverse heart disease . the book is also fast and easy . and the 2nd half of the book is recipes , so i also consider the book short . the book is pretty much in line with what dr. greger recommends , but gives you guidance for the specific condition you are talking about. http : / / www.amazon.com / prevent-reverse-heart-disease-nutrition-based / dp / 1583333002 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 _ pap ? s = books & ie = utf8 & qid = 1433287493 & sr = 1-1 & keywords = prevent + and + reverse + heart + diseasethere are no guarantees once a disease progresses like this . but dr. esselsyn shows that there is every reason to hope . good luck ! i ’ m not seeing where you added exercise to your man ’ s daily life . stents only unclog portions of your arteries , not all your arteries . you need exercise to benefit the entire heart.in clinical practice i have found that most people would rather take a pill than change their diet . when i instruct people how to loose weight to rid themselves of metabolic disease i hear “ easy for you to say . you ’ re skinny ! ” right ! i ’ m vegan ! exactly , americans do not like to diet . we love fast food and cheese . the entire reason a person gets to point of heart surgery is because of their poor diet . so of course american ’ s are going to choose surgery over changing their diet . we have the best medical care in the world , but we are so pathetic when it comes to preventative medicine . our culture would rather fix a problem , than prevent a problem.treatment isn ’ t about what is easy , it is about what is effective . chemotherapy for cancer isn ’ t easy , but it can be effective . what is really sad is that the standards of care for cvd are neither easy nor effective at actually curing the underlying disease . so for people with cvd , easy is simply not an option.it ’ s probably the easier path for many that look for magic solutions without effort ( aka , take the pill ) . in my case , i wanted to get away from prescriptions as much as i could . for weight loss and other reasons , i switched to a vegan diet about 3-4 months ago . i had 2 blood works done so i could compare before / after . among other benefits ( like losing weight , lowering my blood pressure , etc . ) my cholesterol went down from 213 to 140 , just by being vegan . it ’ s sad that people go for the magic solution ( = pill ) instead of realizing how much better they would be if they just change other habits ! it is a false assumption to think doctors favor surgery over diet , its the fact that americans are too gluttonous to bother with a diet . a doctor is just being realistic . americans are far more likely to stuff their face with french fries and cake , as well as use a scooter at walmart . the only realistic option is surgery.the only realistic option is surgeryif after the patient is given all relevant information and then makes an informed decision to ignore the very strong advice to change their diet , then , yes , surgery might indeed be a last resort . but for doctors to not completely inform the patient of options that have a high level of efficacy based on peer reviewed research regardless of whether it is their opinion that the patient will not follow the a given option is simply unethical , and in my opinion rises to the level of malpractice.the know damn well the power that brainwashing and the establishment of deep emotional habits have with people . no doctors that i have ever heard of will do anything more than raise their eyebrows when they mention “ the standard american diet ” . they as a group will not lobby or agitate for any kind of change as a group . look at the ama.the way we have set our whole economy and way of like up as a giant human-destroying machine that serves only a few … and to what purpose , is the biggest tragedy in history . all of our ancestors , crawled out of the oceans , raise themselves up from the slime , fight and died many times over to establish a better humanity , only to have it end as this disgusting inhuman system that uses people as a mean to an end for some end that is unsustainable and toxic anyway ? makes no sense to me.i have been on a plant based diet ( well 98 % ) for a year after having two stents placed lost all the weight exercise eat no oil no sugar no dairy … i do eat two 3 ounce pieces of wild alaskan salmon fresh from alaska i have friends who live there … ( fish oil made me have nose bleeds because of the blood thinner and aspirin combo ) dropped 50 pounds dropped ldl 77 , cholesterol 134 , and trigs 90 hdl 40 … but had a nmr lipid profile and mu apo-b was high 90 my ldl-p was high 1622 my small ldl-p high 855 was told eating way to many carbs and by the way the carbs i eat are all complex not a one refined ( bad ) carb … told maybe family history ( my dad was the only one who died of heart disease none of his sisters and brothers or mom and dad and nobody on my moms side died from heart disease and he smoked heavily drank and ate a sad diet so could that be the reason he died and i didnt eat a perfect diet either so is there a genetic link ? ? ? ) . so was told a mediterranean style diet might be better and has shown if the grains and starchy foods are dropped so will the particle count.and niacin.any suggestions ? the rest of my nmr test came back great except the things i mentioned.now im being told the large douses of deoxidine i was supplementing caused my tsh number to go way high and that will contribute to the raise in particle count ? thanks for your post . i am not sure what dietary approach is best , but i can give some suggestions . have you seen the research by caldwell esselstyn ? we have so much good information about reducing cholesterol and heart disease risk on our site . dr. esselstyn published research showing how a plant-based diet can be “ a way to reverse cad ” . meat can cause inflammation and saturated fat appears to have other deleterious effects such as increasing the risk of heart disease . “ a nutritionally poor dietary pattern , characterized by a high meat and alcohol consumption and low micronutrients intake , is related to an increased stiffening of large arteries . ” other foods that may help arterial stiffness are turmeric and coffee . search mediterranean diet on our site to see more about the research on that type of diet . carbohydrates do not seem to be problematic , if anything , they are very healthful . dr. greger wrote an entire book about “ carbs ” , titled carbophobia , which you can read for free here.with the exception of the fish … i eat a completely plant based diet with no oil no dairy no sugar at all … no simple carbs at all … and i talked to dr esselstyn many times … .he does not want me eating fish but as i said had nose bleeds from fish oil and blood thinner combo and i eat chia seed and flax seed i grind my own ( flax seed ) , but from what i have read the conversion to epa and dha is not enough or is it ? if it is and i cut out the fish then i am 100 % plant based.i dont drink or smoke.this is my dietbreakfast-different meals on different days.1 cup steel rolled oats or quinoa or buckwheat organic whole grain or old fashioned rolled oats ( bob mills ) 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk 1 to 2 cups of mixed fruit .

16	phytates in beans : anti-nutrient or anti-cancer ? in my videos , phytates in the prevention of cancer and phytates for rehabilitating cancer cells , i described how phytates in beans may be the reason why legumes are so successful in preventing cancer and re-educating cancer cells . what about phytates for the treatment of cancer ? colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states . it arises from “ adenomatous polyps , ” meaning that colon cancer starts out as a benign little bump called a polyp and then grows into cancer that can eventually spread to other organs and kill . so the national cancer institute funded the polyp prevention trial , highlighted in my video , phytates for the treatment of cancer , to determine the effects of a high-fiber , high fruit and vegetable , low-fat diet . researchers found no significant associations between polyp formation and overall change in fruit and vegetable consumption . however , those with the greatest increase in bean intake only had about a third of the odds of advanced polyps popping up . it could have been the fiber in the beans , but there ’ s lots of fiber in fruits and vegetables , too . so it may have been the phytate . if the tumors develop from polyps , they still need to spread . tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis are multistep processes that include cell proliferation , digestion through the surrounding tissue , and migration through barrier membranes to reach the bloodstream so the tumor can establish new proliferating colonies of cancer cells . a critical event in tumor cell invasion is the first step : the tunneling through the surrounding matrix . to do this , the cancer cells use a set of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases . this is where phytates might come in . we ’ ve known that phytates inhibit cancer cell migration in vitro , and now perhaps we know why . phytates help block the ability of cancer cells to produce the tumor invasion enzyme in the first place ( at least for human colon and breast cancer cells ) . so what happens if you give phytates to breast cancer patients ? although a few case studies where phytates were given in combination with chemotherapy clearly showed encouraging data , organized , controlled , randomized clinical studies were never done — until now . fourteen women with invasive breast cancer were divided randomly into two groups . one group got extra phytates ; the other got placebo . at the end of six months , the phytate group had a better quality of life , significantly more functionality , fewer symptoms from the chemo , and did not get the drop in immune cells and platelets chemo patients normally experience . what are the potential side effects of phytates ? less heart disease , less diabetes , and fewer kidney stones . because cancer development is such an extended process — it can take decades to grow — we need cancer preventive agents that we can take long-term . phytates , which naturally occur in beans , grains , nuts , and seeds , seem to fit the bill . in the past , there were concerns that the intake of foods high in phytates might reduce the bioavailability of dietary minerals , but recent studies demonstrate that this co-called “ anti-nutrient ” effect can be manifested only when large quantities of phytates are consumed in combination with a nutrient poor diet . for example , there used to be a concern that phytate consumption might lead to calcium deficiency , which then led to weakened bones , but researchers discovered that the opposite was true , that phytates actually protect against osteoporosis ( see phytates for the prevention of osteoporosis ) . in essence , phytates have many characteristics of a vitamin , contrary to the established and , unfortunately , still existing dogma among nutritionists regarding its ‘ anti-nutrient ’ role . as one paper in the international journal of food science & technology suggests : “ given the numerous health benefits , phytates participation in important intracellular biochemical pathways , normal physiological presence in our cells , tissues , plasma , urine , etc . , the levels of which fluctuate with intake , epidemiological correlates of phytate deficiency with disease and reversal of those conditions by adequate intake , and safety – all strongly suggest for phytates inclusion as an essential nutrient , perhaps a vitamin . ” the paper concludes that inclusion of phytates in our diet for prevention and therapy of various ailments , cancer in particular , is warranted . more on preventing tumor invasion and metastasis in : other foods that can help stop the progression of precancerous lesions ( like the adenomatous polyps ) are profiled in strawberries versus esophageal cancer and black raspberries versus oral cancer . there ’ s a substance in mushrooms that ’ s also another “ essential ” nutrient candidate . see ergothioneine : a new vitamin ? loves me some cranberry beans … fruits and vegetables have phytates too . i can ’ t see the association between phytate intakes and colon polyps.i believe it ’ s because they are highly digestable and move thru the gut well vs breads and meats which tend to get stuck and probably partially rot to be crude about it. lolmy point is the most properties of beans are the same for fruits and vegetables.jason , are you sure about that ? because that is not what was stated in the article . so you are saying there is no difference what so ever , that gram to gram , fruits and vegetables have exactly the same amount of phytates as beans . no differences in the nutritional profile at all . frankly , i find that hard to believe.the phytate content of most fruits and vegetables is quite small compared with that of beans and grains . many common fruits don ’ t even have phytates like apples , apricots , bananas , pears , peaches & grapefruit . here ’ s a summary on phytates with charts showing the phytate content of beans , legumes , nuts and seeds. http : / / www.precisionnutrition.com / all-about-phytates-phytic-acidthe studies did not use fruits / vegetables with the same amount fibers as beans for comparison.today nutrition facts was used as a reference on mercola.com. dr mercola sited dr. greger ’ s may 14 , 2015 video on nuts . “ with regards to nuts , one recent study10 found that daily nut consumption translated into an extra two years of longevity , and cut death rates of cancer , heart disease , and respiratory disease . as reported by nutrition facts , “ nut consumers lived significantly longer whether they were older or younger , fat or skinny , whether they exercised more , smoked , drank , or ate other foods that may affect mortality . ” they also busted the myth that nuts ’ high fat content will make you gain weight . ” http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2015 / 05 / 28 / benefits-mediterranean-diet.aspxwhen i first adopted a plant based diet i ate a lot of almonds . i ate between 8-16ozs of almonds a day . as far as they weight goes , i lost 30lbs eating that way . as far as health that was the end of me being sick going on 4 years now . not even a cold.so what is the ideal serving of beans on a daily basis ? thank you.in “ superfoods : fourteen foods that will change your life ” by steven pratt and kathy matthews , they recommend “ at least ” four one-half cup servings a week. http : / / www.superfoodsrx.com / the-superfoods / remember , each 20 gram serving ( about two tablespoons ) reduces your risk of death by eight percent.hey bea . it really depends on what else you are eating , sex , and age , so hard to say . usda recommends 5.0-6.5 ounce equivalents for adult women and men . a 1 / 2 cup of beans is considered a serving.looking for delicious ways to include more beans in your diet ? how about a nice burger ? our black bean beet burger recipe video mentions nutritionfacts.org by name but does not mention phytates . the next one will. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 3jkc1ozyz5mwow , this is really interesting . i have been soaking my grains and beans for years to try to diminish the anti nutrient idea of phytates . my kitchen prep just got easier . many thanks for your great work.what about those who have ibs or ibs-like symptoms and who beans just rip through ? try smaller beans ( lentils ) or cooing them longer , soaking , sprouting , or maybe even a bit of kombu while cooking ? if still problematic perhaps avoid . others may have alternative suggestions.thanks for the response , i ’ ll try that.it ’ s may also be individualized regarding what beans are helpful or harmful ? i have a friend with crohns who swears he cannot eat certain beans , but chickpeas and lentils are fine . i think he is crazy , but i do not take him for a liar . he also claims store bought bread gives him a hard time , but homemade rotti ( he is basically indian ) with whole grain flour and no additives is fine . anecdotally , some of these things help him , but i have no idea how this would relate to others with ibd . see what works for you ! you may also consider talking to your doctor about mucilaginous herbs like slippery elm and marshmallow root . we need way more research here so i was reluctant to even mention , but i feel these herbs ( check with your doctor ) may offer some support and are non-invasive and will not boost a flare . vitamin d and probiotics could help . and also glutamine . lastly , ( or perhaps first ) i would check out dr. greger ’ s videos on ibs . kiwi and cayenne have been found to help , as well . good luck , will . let us know what works ? funny you mention that as i tend to do better when i have chickpeas as opposed to black beans.woohoo ! ! ! go chickpeas . okay , that makes 2 people anecdotally . good luck . let us know what else seems to work . looks like sara has found relief from smaller beans , too.hi will , you can also try to eat small amounts of legumes frequently , instead of having quite large servings . i have light ibs symptoms ( largely improved on a wfpbd ) , and if i eat legumes this way i don ’ t experience discomfort afterwards . so , small amounts of legumes per meal , always soaked and well cooked until very soft . i also tolerate some of them better , for example the delicious lentils of which i can eat a big plate : ) . joseph is right.one mans medicine can be another mans poison.what recent studies , besides the one example given , is dr. greger referencing in this statement : “ recent studies demonstrate that this co-called “ anti-nutrient ” effect can be manifested only when large quantities of phytates are consumed in combination with a nutrient poor diet ” ? i wondered this also . wouldn ’ t a diet high in phytates be high in nutrients due to the nature of phytate-containing foods ? i make hummus 2-3 times a week and use 2 cups of dry chickpeas that i soak overnight to cut down the cooking time . should i start cooking them raw to increase the phytates ? thanks : - ) dr. greger , could you talk about saponins as a risk for increasing gut permeability ? i ’ ve been studying auto imumune diseases and they talk a lot about that and abou avoiding nightshade family . i appreciate. antinutrients , beans , breast cancer , breast health , calcium , cancer , cancer survival , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chemotherapy , colon cancer , colon health , diabetes , fiber , fruit , grains , heart disease , heart health , kidney health , kidney stones , low-fat diets , metastases , mortality , national cancer institute , nuts , osteoporosis , phytates , phytic acid , polyps , prediabetes , seeds , side effects , vegetables , vitamins , women 's health - -
17	how phytates fight cancer cells phytate is a compound found in beans , grains , nuts and seeds . the average daily intake of phytate in vegetarian diets is about twice that of those eating mixed diets of plant and animal foods , which may help explain their low cancer rates . aside from helping to prevent cancer , dietary phytate has been reported to help prevent kidney stone formation , protect against diabetes mellitus , dental cavities , and heart disease . do all these potentially beneficial effects sound too good to be true ? are there other examples of compounds made by plants that can have benefits across multiple diseases ? why yes ! aspirin , for example , which is found throughout the plant kingdom may also account for a variety of plant-based benefits ( see aspirin levels in plant foods ) . but of all the things phytates can do , the anticancer activity of phytate ( also known as phytic acid , ip6 , or inositol hexaphosphate ) , is considered one of its most important beneficial activities . dietary phytates are quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly taken up by cancer cells throughout the body , and have been shown to inhibit the growth of all tested cancerous cell lines in vitro . phytates have been shown to inhibit the growth of human leukemia cells , colon cancer cells , both estrogen receptor-positive and negative breast cancer cells , voicebox cancer , cervical cancer , prostate cancer , liver tumors , pancreatic , melanoma , and muscle cancers . all at the same time not affecting normal cells . that ’ s the most important expectation of a good anticancer agent : the ability to only affect cancerous cells and to leave normal cells alone . in my video , phytates for rehabilitating cancer cells , you can see how leukemia cells taken from cancer patients are killed by phytates , whereas normal bone marrow cells , are spared . this may explain why bean extracts kill off colon cancer cells in vitro , but leave normal colon cells alone . what are the mechanisms of action by which phytates battle cancer ? in other words , how do phytates fight ? how don ’ t they fight ? phytate targets cancer through multiple pathways , a combination of antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , immune-enhancing activities , detox , differentiation , and anti-angiogenesis . in other words , phytate appears to affect all the principal pathways of malignancy . the antioxidative property is one of the most impressive characteristics of phytate . in fact that ’ s why the meat industry adds phytates to meat to prevent the fat oxidation that begins at the moment of slaughter . phytates can also act on our immune functions by augmenting natural killer cell activity , the cells in our body that hunt down and dispose of cancer cells , as well as neutrophils , which help form our first line of defense . and then phytates starve tumors as more of a last line of defense . not only can phytates block the formation of new blood vessels that may be feeding tumors , but disrupt pre-formed capillary tubes , indicating that phytates may not just help blockade tumors , but actively cut off existing supply lines . what ’ s really remarkable about phytate , though , is that unlike most other anti-cancer agents , it not only causes a reduction in cancer cell growth but also enhances differentiation , meaning it causes cancer cells to stop acting like cancer cells and go back to acting like normal cells . you can see this with colon cancer cells for example . in the presence of phytates , human colon cancer cells mature to structurally and behaviorally resemble normal cells . and this has been demonstrated in leukemia cells , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and muscle cancer cells as well . for more on the cancer and phytate connection , check out phytates for the prevention of cancer and phytates for the treatment of cancer . this video reminds me of my video on the spice , turmeric , turmeric curcumin reprogramming cancer cell death . what else can we eat to improve the cancer-fighting front of our immune system ? see boosting natural killer cell activity . more on the concept of starving tumors of their blood supply in anti-angiogenesis : cutting off tumor supply lines . is there clinical evidence of plants actually reversing cancer progression ? you won ’ t believe your eyes : mindblown ! did not know that it was possible for cancer cells to differentiate back to normal cells.dear dr. greger , why is the phosphorus in pyhtic acid good for us but the phosphorus in phosphorus food additives bad for us ? ( the consumption of phosphorus preservatives in junk food and injected into meat may damage blood vessels , accelerate the aging process , and contribute to osteoporosis . , from phosphate additives in meat purge and cola ) thank you , paulathat ’ s a good question , paulae . you mentioned dr. greger ’ s video on phosphate additives and there are some answers there . i think of this kind of like beta-carotene supplements vs. beta-carotene from foods . whereas the beta-carotene from foods are beneficial , but the supplements are harmful . once nutrients are extracted by themselves their efficacy becomes more unstable and often harmful . whole food is the way to go ! another example are naturally occurring nitrites in vegetables like celery . they are perfectly fine in vegetables , but once extracted and used to treat processed meats , nitrites can form dangerous compounds knows as nitrosamaines.your body uses phosphorus in every energy reaction it makes . most of the energy you use in a day is used by your brain or in maintaining your body temperature at 98 degrees . phosphorous is very in demand by your body . so any phosphorus that is bonded to something else , like calcium or an organic , carbon based chemical organo phosphates , or in phosphoric acid as in dark soda , is going to at least slow your body down or get pasted into bones or mitochondria as a compound at worst . so getting clean phosphorus is very important to your body ’ s homeostasis . beans have a lot of phosphorus , thank you for pointing this out to me , this is what i should be eating , as does whole grain . developing a phosphorous deficiency is very dangerous because one of the only ways to see if you have one is if the body has already started leaching phosphorus from your bones and is putting it in the blood stream . many people already have one . too much phosphorus in the blood could mean you need more , not less . people who had diets rich in phosphorus had great bone health later in life. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25856461i have been baking my own whole grain bread for several years . before i bake my bread , i take care to let the dough rise for long time by natural fermentation . many years ago i was taught , that by doing this , the enzyme phytase will break down the phytate in the grain , thereby making the mineral content more available for our digestive system . but does that mean , that i am going to miss some of the cancer prevention from the phytate ? anyway , in my ( and several of friends opinion ) this slow food process makes a delicious bread . i also guess , that other processes during the rising of the dough is enhancing the food value.great question . i don ’ t think all phytates will be removed . keep in mind phytates are found in so many plant-based foods ! i think what you ’ re doing is just fine , as homemade bread sounds delicious and perhaps even more healthy than store-bought depending what ’ s in it.is the phytic acid actually removed or is it simply broken down into other forms ? hi harriet i am not sure . want to dig around and find out for us ? i know you are research savvy : - ) it would probably be in the introduction or discussion section of any of these studies . my guess is broken down.your guess is correct . the phytic acid is actually degraded — hydrolyzed , or converted to inositol and phosphate , its component parts , explained dr. aaron cowieson , professor of animal nutrition at the university of sydney . ( dr. barbara harland , us expert on phytates in human nutrition , suggested i speak with cowieson . ) structurally , phytic acid is composed of 6 phosphate groups attached to an inner ring of inositols . it ’ s the inositols that are so important . they help control blood sugar and have exhibited many anti-cancer properties . the phosphate groups , however , must be sequentially removed for the inositols to be available , said cowieson.proper soaking techniques , he said , can activate phytase enzyme , which initiates the removal of several phosphate groups . when that partially degraded phytate reaches the small intestine , other enzymes break down the remaining phosphate groups , leaving the inositols exposed.what soaking techniques does cowieson recommend ? foods high in phytase enzyme ( rye , barley , buckwheat , wheatbran , ricebran ) can be soaked overnight at low ph ( 2-4 , which you can achieve by adding some lemon / citric acid ) . most foods with phytic acid , however , don ’ t have much endogenous phytase enzyme . cowieson suggests soaking those foods overnight at low ph with a source of phytase enzyme ( one of those mentioned above ) — and slightly cracking any hard outer shells so that the phytase can travel from one source to another.what about the recommendation for soaking beans in baking soda to decrease raffinose and avoid gas ? wouldn ’ t that avoid activation of phytase enzyme ? i am a bit confused here … and would that all be the same for soy beans ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / does-adding-baking-soda-to-soaking-beans-reduce-raffinose / hi , dorange , yes , it does seem that soaking beans in an alkaline solution would not lead to the activation of phytase enzyme , according to what cowieson says.if gas is your concern , brenda davis , the dietitian who wrote “ becoming vegan ” and whom dr. greger often quotes , suggests cooking beans in kombu to counteract gas . she has lots more suggestions for gas here. http : / / zesterdaily.com / cooking / healthy-way-good-fortune-new-years / ( oh , how i wish somebody would explain how to hyperlink in these comments ! ) i ’ m not sure what you mean by your last question.thanks , harriet ! so i ’ d better keep soaking my beans in an acidic solution ! i don ’ t have any concern with gas , but good to know about kombu . interesting that i used to cook my beans with it to benefit from its mineral content ! have to go back to doing this ! thanks for the article ! my second question refers to whether soy ” behaves ” as all the other legumes . i believe it does ? ps : i believe hyperlinking is not possible in this platform … : ( as far as i know , soy behaves the same way.thanks for the postscript.help me , joseph . please tell me how to hyperlink to sources . i tried doing it in word and then copying and pasting here , but that didn ’ t work.it ’ s an html code that took me a bit to learn ; - ) here is a link that can help visit our html tutorial ! so , it ’ s possible , after all ! : ) why then are we told to soak our nuts and grains and beans to remove the phytates and other nutritional inhibitors ? because someone said phytate is bad . it got repeated so much it eventually became fact . welcome to the machinephytates only act as nutritional inhibitors when they are eaten in excess in a diet already low in minerals. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / phytates-for-the-treatment-of-cancerand vegan diets can can be low in zinc.perhaps soaking does more then just reduce phytates ? dr. greger mentions how soaking or adding baking soda to beans helps reduce raffinose , which can increase flatulence ( gas ) . that said , beans and gas are not all cracked up to be what most people claim ( i.e. if you eat beans you have tons of gas ) . there are still phytates that remain after soaking , just fewer . keep in mind we obtain phytates from many foods if eating a healthy fiber-rich diet.great read ! ! sorry to change the subject but just want to let all migraine sufferers know what ’ s worked for me . i have suffered from chronic migraine for over 20 years now and pain killers and medication had stopped working , with these headaches i would also get a high temperature , i read on cure zone a possible cure using apple cider vinegar and honey and water , so in desperation i decided to try it and wow it has made a massive difference , i have never felt better , no migraine or temperature since i started 2 months ago , it ’ s a miracle cure i ’ m glad i found just wish i knew about it 20 years ago ! ! i should be grateful if u would discuss the benefits of acv dr gregor as i believe it deserves lots of credit . thanks a millbut what about beans and legumes being relatively high in methionine and methionine ’ s ability to worsen cancer ? i am fighting advanced stage iv prostate cancer and i have been restricting methionine to 2mg / kg per day so it doesn ’ t leave a lot of room for delicious beans . i had been vegan for most of my life but jumped on the paleo bandwagon for two years – long enough for my psa to go from 6.0 before to 150.0 after and gleason score 8 in 12 / 12 specimens with mets all over so i believe that i unmasked a latent prostate cancer which went wild in the presence of all that animal protein . after treatment and having returned to my vegan diet the psa went to 0.039 so i am pleased but want to keep it that way with a methionine restriction . incidentally , my parents raised me as vegan since about age 11 ( with a very , very strong family history of cancer on both sides ) . i started treatment and returned to a vegan diet at the same time . there was no big drop after starting treatment ( lupron ) but a slow and steady decline of the psa over the past 18 months . in other words , i am not sure i got some jolting good effect from treatment so much as staying on a vegan diet . but i cut beans out about two months ago and wonder if i did the right thing . i am figuring 150mg methionine per day , which doesn ’ t allow for many beans.hi chiron . thanks for sharing your story . glad to hear your psa is going down . thanks for pointing out methionine . dr. greger addresses this in his video on methionine restriction . the recommended dietary allowance for methionine and cysteine are 1209 mg per day in a person weighing about 140 pounds . so 150mg seems a bit low . check with your doctor for clarification but i see no problem with eating beans . when i think of psa numbers dropping i think of dr. ornish ’ s work . beans have so many healthful components ( fiber , antioxidants , phytonutrients ) and have been shown to help fight cancer . warm thoughts.sincerely , josephone thing that confuses me about dr. ornish , is that he recommends skim milk . i remember reading a lot about milk promoting prostate cancer . dr. greger has some good info , too. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 02 / 17 / organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer / thanks for sharing that link , julie ! thanks , joseph . i don ’ t mean to put too fine a point on it , but it seemed that the seminal article was one you must be familiar with – epner , morrow , et al in nutr cancer – 2002 ( 42 ) 2 : 158 : 66 nutrient intake and nutrient indexes in adults with metastatic cancer … etc . he demonstrated a 58 % reduction in serum methionine when it was kept at 2mg / kg for research subjects . while the rda is much higher for both methionine and cysteine ( don ’ t you mean cystine in the case of cancer ? ) , it seems the therapeutic range would be much lower . i figure i am in uncharted territory here , but i figure it ’ s like flossing your teeth . you can floss all you want at the normal rda , but once you get cancer you need to do something more drastic than floss . from personal experience i can tell you that a patient can have a great and healthy diet on this severe methionine restriction . i just don ’ t want to be cutting out something that might be helpful.secondly , and perhaps this is the wrong venue for this discussion , mccarty et al in medical hypotheses ( the low-methionine content of vegan diets … etc ) say that one can reduce one ’ s methionine levels by “ ingesting ample amounts of fruit , wine , and / or beer . ” . i can ’ t figure out why they said that can you ? all i have been able to find is evidence that methionine restriction reduces insulin-like growth factor-1 ( igf-1 ) while alcohol seems to increase the presence of insulin-like growth factor binding protein – 1 ( igfbp-1 ) . any ideas ? i should disclose that i am a naturopathic doctor.thanks for clarifying . mentioning a fine point or study on this site is one of the main purposes of this interactive forum , so no worries there : - ) i have not seen that study by epner . i am not sure the correct spelling of the amino acid “ cystine ” i thought is was cysteine ? at any rate you are of course in a situation where trying anything may help your prognosis . my only thought for eating beans was the fiber , antioxidants , and phytonutrients that are found in beans . every study i have read on beans seem to be very helpful . you could certainly avoid if you feel that ’ s the best choice . it may be ? as a nd you probably know more about this research than me ! i agree with you about the alcohol and ifg-i , not sure why that paper would mentions alcohol being helpful for prostate cancer ? my research href = ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24870117 ″ target = ” _ blank ” > applying the precautionary principle to nutrition and cancer shows “ limiting or avoiding alcohol may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth , pharynx , larynx , esophagus , colon and rectum , and breast . ” so even though prostate cancer is not on that list i would be weary to too much booze , if any . let me know if you want more links to dr. greger ’ s videos on igf-i.best to you , josephwow , joseph , i am touched that you responded so thoughtfully . cystine is an amino acid made of two cysteines bonded in a more stable form . i don ’ t suppose it matters much really – you can ’ t easily absorb cystine so it ’ s not nearly as good a medicine . cysteine is , of course , used in the body in many reactions such as making glutathione ( which is a good thing ) , and is most familiar as n-acetyl-cysteine which has been proven to be a good medicine . the only thing is , there is an article by liu , zhang , wang et al that describe how the dual deprivation of methionine and cystine has a powerful synergistic effect on glioma cells – it both prevents their proliferation and induces what they call “ autophagy ” which i presume to mean that the glioma cells eat themselves.and , it wasn ’ t necessarily my nd that made me familiar with the literature , it was cancer . and , for all readers i really urge you all to go to pubmed.gov which is the library of congress site which includes medical research from all over the world . it ’ s free and open to the public . as far as the alcohol , well , i concur with the conventional literature – particularly the medscape article which declared “ no amount of alcohol is safe ” .as part of my research for an upcoming book on diet and cancer , i interviewed an australian doctor who is studying methionine restriction and cancer . due to an embargo on publication , he was not able to discuss some of his recent research but when i asked him what he ’ d do about methionine if he had cancer , he said he ’ d probably restrict methionine to 1 g / day.how would we * translate * 1g into food intake , harriet ? avoiding protein altogether ? looking forward to know more about his findings and your book ! re : protein and canceryou can go to the nutrition data website and search under “ tools , ” then “ nutrient search , ” for foods highest and lowest in methionine ( or in many other compounds ) . you can also refine those searches according to food categories ( legumes , fruits , grains , vegetables , etc . ) here ’ s the link : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / tools / nutrient-searchas you probably know , glutamine ( glutamic acid ) is another amino acid that some cancers feed on – in particular cancers in which the myc oncogene is involved . ( that includes many brain cancers – and other kinds too . ) http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2917518 / glutamine activates mtorc1 signaling . it flips and then keeps open the switch that allows “ grow ” signals to be sent – telling cells , including cancer cells , to grow.leucine , an amino acid predominantly in dairy , does that , too . see http : / / eatandbeatcancer.com / 2014 / 07 / 23 / anti-cancer-diets-whats-the-deal-with-dairy / so in answer to your question , yes , if you have cancer , limiting protein seems to be a wise strategy . in fact , calorie restriction and periodic fasting may also be in order.and make sure you incorporate foods that inhibit mtorc signalling , includinggreen teacrucifersturmericorganic , whole soyresveratrol ( skins of red , purple and muscadine grapes , also blueberries and mulberries ) source : dr. bodo melnik , german dermatologist who has published widely on dairy-acne-prostate cancer link . see http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3408989 / metformin , a drug commonly used to control insulin levels in type 2 diabetics , also lowers mtorc signaling , he says . see http : / / www.jscimedcentral.com / endocrinology / endocrinology-spid-antidiabetic-drug-metformin-1029.pdfthanks , harriet ! interesting about the role of the drug metformin … have you ever heard of the reverse warburg effect , a theory by dr. michael lisanti ? google “ the autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer metabolism ” . there ’ s a very interesting small talk by him here . metformin , besides being a mtor inhibitor , it is a powerful antioxidant and autophagy inducer , and it ’ s being successful in reducing tumor mass when alternating with an autophagy inhibitor , like chloroquine ( yes , the malaria medicine ) . n-acetylcysteine is another powerful autophagy inducer , like metformin . watch his talk , search his research , you ’ ll be fascinated.so does that mean soaked and sprouted grains are better or worse for us ? hi briana . i don ’ t think so . please see my comment below , as this is a great question that many people have been asking ! thanks for your comment.it ’ s possible to get too much fiber.volvulus of the sigmoid colonit ’ s possible to get too much fiber. http : / / www.meb.uni-bonn.de / dtc / primsurg / docbook / html / x3450.htmlsure. especially if someone has undergone gastric bypass . in healthy individuals fiber can take some getting used to they are new to eating large amounts . dr. greger touches on cruciferous veggies and how much is too much . see if that helps ? lastly , check out how much fiber humans used to eat in this blog ! it is quite shocking . thanks for the comments , jacki eat them all the time , love them , glad we have them to fight cancerdoes this have anything to do with “ phytic acid ” ? i ’ ve heard from some vegans that they soak their beans and grains to reduce this acid because it depletes some things like zinc , magnesium , iron and calcium and inhibits enzyme function . when they soak the beans and grains it neutralizes the acid . so , what is going on ? is it best to soak or not ? is this interfering with the health benefits listed above ? yay , dr. greger ! very glad you ’ ve written this article and posted several new videos – thank you . was speaking with someone just last week about all the ip-6 / phytates do to help against cancer , promote good health and the bad wrap they ’ ve gotten . also glad that dr. shamsuddin , who ’ s pioneering research on phytates back in the 1990 ’ s at the university of maryland , has a chance to get more recognition for his great work . he indicates that ip6 breaks down in our systems to ip3 , which facilitates cellular communication , so cancer cells can once again ‘ hear ’ the message to differentiate or die . he ’ s got a couple of books you can find on amazon … eat your beans ! have you come across any pediatric research using phytates to halt malignant tumor growth ? my niece died from a very aggressive medulloblastoma , despite being stage 0 and 100 % surgically removed , full rounds of chemo and intense radiation , it still grew back at the same site . we simply had no ways of halting the growth . if you have come across any brain research , pediatric or otherwise , with the use of phytates , would you please post ? maybe some other little one will be able to make it.i soak , sprout , then cook my beans . how much phytic acid is left after this ? what is your recommendation regarding preparation ? if phytates are good for us and help to prevent cancer , should we be soaking our nuts to remove the phytates as with earlier recommendations ? or how much / what forms of phytates are good for us ? you people ought tom stop worrying about what you eat , tomorrow you could get knocked down by a busamazing – we are fearfully and wonderfully made ! ! ! i am a raw vegan , so i don ’ t eat beans ; i do eat raw buckwheat though which contains phytates . however , the phytates are reduced when soaked or sprouted , so is it ok to eat raw and unsoaked ?

18	colon cancer prevention : is it the fiber or the phytates ? dietary factors are considered the most important environmental risk factors for cancer . within recent years , a large number of naturally occurring health-enhancing substances of plant origin known as phytonutrients have been recognized to have beneficial effects on certain cancers . beans , chickpeas , split peas and lentils are packed with all sorts of wonderful nutrients , but the reason they may protect against several degenerative diseases may be due to non-nutritive compounds , or even so-called “ antinutrient ” compounds like phytates . phytates have a somewhat negative reputation for binding to certain minerals ( like iron , zinc and manganese ) and slowing their absorption . but they have also been found to offer anti-inflammatory health benefits . “ the reputation of phytate has had a roller coaster ride ever since its discovery ; it has undergone alternate eminence and infamy . ” ( i previously explored the surprising new science about phytates in my video phytates for the prevention of osteoporosis ) . could they play a potential role in preventing colon cancer ? in the u.s. , colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death , but some parts of the world have had just a tiny fraction of our rates , with the highest rates reported in connecticut , and the lowest in kampala , uganda . the famous surgeon denis burkitt spent 24 years in uganda and most of the hospitals he contacted there had never seen a case of colon cancer . noting they live off diets centered on whole plant foods , he figured that maybe it was the fiber that was so protective . some studies have called that interpretation into question . danes appear to have more colon cancer than finns , yet danes consume almost twice the dietary fiber . what else , then , could explain the low cancer rates among plant-based populations ? well , fiber isn ’ t the only thing found in whole plant foods , but missing from processed and animal foods . maybe it ’ s the phytate . dietary phytate , rather than fiber per se , may be the most important variable governing the frequency of colon cancer , as phytate is known to be a powerful inhibitor of the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl radicals , a particularly dangerous type of free radical . so the standard american diet may be a double whammy , the heme iron in muscle meat plus the lack of phytate in refined plant foods to extinguish the iron radicals . this may account for what researchers found in the adventist study , highlighted in my video , phytates for the prevention of cancer . they found excess risk of cancer for higher intakes of both red meat and white meat , suggesting all meats contribute to colon cancer formation — about twice the risk for red meat eaters , and three times the risk for those eating chicken and fish . those who eat meat could reduce their risk in two ways : by cutting down on meat or by eating more beans , an excellent source of phytates . so it ’ s not just how much meat we eat , but our meat to vegetables ratio . between the two extremes ( high-vegetable and low-meat diets versus high-meat and low-vegetable diets ) a risk ratio of about eight appears to exist , sufficient to explain a substantial part of the international variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer . those with the worst of both worlds , high meat and low vegetable , were at eight times the risk . more on colon cancer in stool size matters . here are a few of my latest videos on the latest wonders of the musical fruit : what about that music , though ? see my blog beans and gas : clearing the air . what about soybeans and cancer ? see breast cancer survival and soy and brca breast cancer genes and soy . other ways to mediate the effects of meat intake can be found in my video reducing cancer risk in meateaters . for more about how phytates may play a role in both cancer prevention and treatment see phytates for rehabilitating cancer cells and phytates for the treatment of cancer . beans , beans , beans ! maybe the single most important food to include in your daily diet ? thanks for all the hard work dr. greger and staff ! b12 supplements issues with me . anyone else here have issues ? http : / / www.livestrong.com / article / 355766-vitamin-b12-supplement-dangers / “ vitamin b12 supplements may cause blood clots and heart failure . patients with a history of cardiovascular problems should avoid b12 supplements . blood clots develop in the lower extremities and may dislodge and travel to the heart and brain , causing heart attack and stroke . b12 supplements may cause the heart to stop functioning normally , leading to decreased transport of oxygenated blood to body organs . patients with heart failure often experience problems breathing due to accumulation of fluids in the lungs , sudden weight gain , edema , fatigue and shortness of breath . ” can you provide a link to the studies behind these statements ? it is important to discuss any supplements and medications with your doctor . b12 is commonly prescribed ( especially for those over 50 years old ) , according to the institute of medicine . i have not seen these kind of issues the link addresses , and not sure what studies the article is referencing . b12 is super important . adults needs roughly 2.4 micrograms per day . in supplement form it comes in higher doses . cheapest source of b12 . here is more on b12 and dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations. if interested . thanks.vegetarians need b12 supplementation , since the richest natural source comes from meats.sorry that is a well known old wives tail which , as it turns out is not true . there is some evidence that b12 in meat is not in a bioavailable form. or that the high stomach acid levels required for meat consumption destroy any b12 present . there is good evidence from studies such as the framingham offspring study that you are more likely to have sub normal levels of b12 if you do eat meat.when i was a meat eater , i needed b12 injections . i went vegan 3 years ago , and had my blood work done recently , everything was normal ! b12 among everything else was fine . also a side note , i have crohn ’ s disease , that was getting worse until i changed my diet , a colonoscopy last year showed that it was healing . my incurable disease is healing ! it ’ s so nice note to be in all that pain ! i think you have misunderstood something . truly i am interested if you can back it up with a pathophysiological explanation and some references to articles . if you have ever seen a young person with subacute combined degeneration caused by a vitamin b12 deficiency , you will make sure to supplement with b12 ! this is important : if you are vegan you have to take a b12 supplement ! b12 is stored in the body , correct ? so will people who have recently become vegans have ample stores ? could you give those people any guidelines on how long they could go without supplementing ? what would those guidelines depend on – on how long and how much meat they ate ? on the quality of their intestinal bacteria ? does fermentable fiber increase your ability to use b12 ? check out the article which veggie eric shared below , for good solid footnoted information about b12. http : / / www.vibrancyuk.com / b12.htmlharriet , i am not an expert in the metabolism of b12 , but in general i dont have a problem with supplementations , if you know what you are doing . i would recommend everybody to supplement with b12 as soon as they go plant based and also consider d-vitamin unless they live in a very sunny place.according to the links provided in the referenced article. what are being described are allergic reactions to cyanocobalamin . neither article says anything about methylcobalamin , the natural form of b12 . this is the first sentence from the drug.com page referenced on the livestrong page . ” when used in small doses , no common side effects have been reported with this product ” . the author of the article also states that “ b12 is naturally present only in animal foods ” . since the writer does not even understand where b12 comes from . clearly this article was either written out of ignorance , or possibly as an attempt to mislead people.b12 from methylcobalamin might work for some , but go ahead and read online some of the horror stories people have experienced after taking methyl b12 . i am not going to post all these peoples ’ comments , but i do not think they are lying . something about the methylcobalamin form of b12 really changed their body for the worse . yeah , i really doubt these people are making this up . and i am one of those people . really screwed with my body . maybe there is something bigger going on in people with bad reactions — — — maybe they have a “ leak ” somewhere in their body that allows substances into places where they do not belong . i do not know.i have no idea what your objective is . the posts you have made have taken things out of context . both of the articles linked from the livestrong post are about rare allergic reactions to cyanocobalamin the synthetic version of b12 . you can find the same list of adverse reactions for any vitamin . here is the one for vitamin c http : / / www.drugs.com / sfx / vitamin-c-side-effects.html . if you are trying to convince people that meat is the only safe place to get b12 . you are going to have a tough time , people here are smarter than that.not trying to convince people to eat meat . letting people know that there are good meaning folks out there who are experience harmful reactions to b12 supplements . and not just the cyanocobalamin . take the time to read people ’ s stories . b12 supplements in any form can be a scary experience for some us . this has nothing to do with trying to get people to eat meat . today i am a vegan and hope to remain that way.guest , if you are having these problems , try methyl b12 and for the love of god get off the meat , dairy and fats so your body can begin to heal.guest : really ? ok , i ’ ll bite … so what are these b12 supplement issues you are personally having ? can you please list them specifically so we can try to help ? or … possibly , that article was written to be misleading and a blatant unsubstantiated pot-shot at vegans who normally supplement with b12.what non-animal products is b12 in ? and real b12 , not the inactive form.clearly you know nothing about b12 , what is synthetic and what isn ’ t , or even the source of b12 . certainly you could manage to find the b12 page on wikipedia or lookup some of the many articles and videos about b12 on this site . you should learn about it so you aren ’ t posting things which mislead.no doubt that getting b12 from meat is the most dangerous way – b12 from meat is associated with heart disease , stroke , kidney disease , cancer , diabetes , hypertension and autoimmune diseasespirulina , nori , tempeh , and barley grass all forms or natural b12 … natural b12 is made by bacteria in the soil having nothing to do with coming from an animal or not … i ’ m sorry but “ livestrong ” is not an authority on nutrition but rather a pro-meat eater blog site where people like ms. sherry post misleading information about vegan topics like the wildly inaccurate b12 post you linked to above … it ’ s interesting that there have been a few recent “ guest ” posts here linking to “ live strong ” vegan bashing articles lately . you and the blogger ms. sherry should probably read up more on b12 before you write / post another misleading article like the one you linked to above.great read here about b12 ~ ~ > http : / / www.vibrancyuk.com / b12.htmlquote from the article “ dr michael klaper argues that vitamin b12 is present in the mouth as well and intestines ” b12 gives me very painful canker sores and they last for week or so . i am a vegan but i don ’ t take b12 supplements , just try to do the best i can through diet.maybe check the ingredients list on your b12 sups . there might be an offending ingredient agitating your cancer sores not the actual b12 itself . also , some cancer sores can be caused by stress like ulcers and most cancer sores are linked to dairysee here ~ ~ > http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / apthous-ulcer-mystery-solved / i looked up the causes of canker sores , according to the mayo clinic , canker sores are caused by : a minor injury to your mouth from dental work , overzealous brushing , sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bitetoothpastes and mouth rinses containing sodium lauryl sulfatefood sensitivities , particularly to chocolate , coffee , strawberries , eggs , nuts , cheese , and spicy or acidic foodsa diet lacking in vitamin b-12 , zinc , folate ( folic acid ) or ironan allergic response to certain bacteria in your mouthhelicobacter pylori , the same bacteria that cause peptic ulcershormonal shifts during menstruationemotional stressnotice that low b12 levels are associated with canker sores . you should be consulting with your doctor to figure out what is actually going on . although you find correlation between b12 and your canker sores , it is quite possible that b12 itself is not causing your canker sores.i have to say i have never heard of b12 supplements causing heart attacks ? the author has only had 5 yrs experience as a nurse , she says she ’ s been ‘ published ’ on a couple websites ? i can ’ t believe she actually tries to pull that statement off on the masses . very poor . i would have been embarrassed to have written such a statement . it shows she is a very young nurse giving her opinion on those non-meat eaters needing b12 , they should just eat dead animals ! not . my background and study in nutrition trumps her quite a bit as i ’ ve been a nurse for 38 yrs and have 2 masters under my belt , one as a family nurse practitioner . she is trying to draw in credibility by saying she is ‘ published ’ , what she is trying to do is tickle the ears of people who don ’ t know what that means , off course now she can add livestrong to her list of ‘ websites ’ . to say you are published means in a peer review scientific journal , that is hard to do , not your girlfriend ’ s $ 29 / mth website . i write things on my two websites all the time , but i would be laughed out of town if i tried to pass that off as being ‘ published ’ . her flare for the drama is seen in the bio , which the author themself is usually the one who writes , and it seems she has added some froth from the extra dairy fat and beef lard to that one , lol . the long arms of the beef / dairy industry are always around us . now i will say , there are some people who have a genetic disorder with the mthfr genes that will cause abnormalities in their processing of folate and b12 , the signs are close to what she says is for risk for ordinary folk taking b12 supplementation . that shows her lack of knowledge concerning the misinformation she is publishing . this gal has enough medical background to be dangerous.i also want to add , the only folk i have seen in need of b12 shots are meat eaters . vegans usually take care of them selves far better than a run of the mill american sad eater . vegans usually try to buy organic , which means more b12 is being created on the surface , no roundup or heavy pesticides on organic foods to kill off the b12 producing bacteria and archaea . my b12 has always been above normal and i have been a veg-head for 28 years.dr. greger , does soaking the beans ( and throwing out the water ) have any impact on the amount of phytates contained in the cooked beans ? yes , soaking can reduce phytates , but not completely removed them . brenda davis rd discusses the impact of soaking and sprouting in her book , becoming raw . i found one study that showed soaking faba beans can lower phytates . germinating the beans did even better.is there any way you can post the study you mentioned ? the link was a dead end . thanks.fixed. sorry about thatthanks.when you soak beans & thereby reduce the phytates , where do the phytates go ? do they go into the soaking water ? is it a good idea to use the soaking water for cooking the beans or is it better to discard it & use fresh water ? what a great question i have no idea ! can anyone else help me here ? let me check brenda davis ’ s book on soaking and phytates she has ample references . my thought is soaking is still fine it can reduce fructooligosaccharides and phytates and that is okay . eating them is most important no matter how you prepare beans.here ’ s what i understand from talking with many food scientists as well as with brenda davis . if anybody has any corrections or additions , feel free to chime in.plant seeds , including grains and legumes , store phosphorus for future growth as phytate ( phytic acid ) . when you soak those seeds under the right conditions ( warm water temperatures , appropriate ph ) , you activate their phytase enzyme , which then begins the process of breaking down phytate . as the seeds continue to soak , they start germinating – breaking down phytate and releasing phosphorus to support future growth.some grains have quite a bit of phytase enzyme – rye , barley and wheat do , for example . oats generally don ’ t because they ’ re usually heat-treated , which destroys the enzyme . legumes vary , but in general don ’ t have as much phytase enzyme as rye , barley and wheat.one scientist i spoke with suggested you could soak some cracked rye berries with some cracked legumes in warm water , and the phytase in the rye would help break down the phytic acid in the legumes – but that ’ s a lot of work , especially when the phytic acid is health-promoting.phytic acid is sometimes called the dilemma of human nutrition . the main problem is that it binds certain minerals – including calcium , iron and zinc . the solution for us vegans ( and for those in third world countries ) may be to avoid eating major sources of those minerals along with foods rich in phytate and to consume foods that enhance absorption of those minerals . quercetin and tannic acid may enhance zinc uptake , for example . ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20546406 ) and dr. greger talks about onions ( their outer layers are rich in quercetin ) somewhere on this siteas for the oligosaccharides , the fermentable carbs that cause gas , yes , soaking will help reduce them . but they get into the soaking water , says davis , so cook beans in fresh water . for those who have not yet digested davis ’ terrific book , “ becoming vegan , ” here are her suggestions for cooking beans. http : / / zesterdaily.com / cooking / healthy-way-good-fortune-new-years / in denmark people eat a lot of fruit and vegetables , but the problem is that the the meals are centered around the meat , and vegetables are a small side dish . lunch are often rye bread ( lots of fiber ) , but on top different kinds of meat – eg “ leverpostej ” ( chopped liver and blubber – i dont know if it exist in other countries ) , sausage , ham and so on . barbecuing is almost a sport in the summer . regarding alcohol we are probably too liberal . legumes are only eaten by very few . most men in denmark thinks that a real man eats meat , but as dr . greger has illustrated several times – real men eats plants ! this is not meant to be argumentative but i ’ m confused about something dr. greger says in the article . he says , “ [ d ] ietary phytate , rather than fiber per se , may be the most important variable governing the frequency of colon cancer , as phytate is known to be a powerful inhibitor of the iron-mediated production of hydroxyl radicals , a particularly dangerous type of free radical . so the standard american diet may be a double whammy , the heme iron in muscle meat plus the lack of phytate in refined plant foods to extinguish the iron radicals . ” if [ one of ] the big issue [ s ] is with iron , why would the rates of colon cancer only double for red meat eaters , but triple for those eating chicken and fish ? seems like that should be the exact opposite given the above quote about hydroxyl radicals.hey vmnc . good thoughts thanks for your comment . i think dr. greger was just referencing this article in regards to the quote about phytates being possibly more important than fiber . i am not sure that is the whole story . he still has hundreds of video on fiber showing its benefit.with a history of pre-cancerous polyps , i changed my diet in august 2013 to include many servings of beans each week as well as a high daily intake of fresh vegetables . i avoid processed food as best as possible . i dropped 30 pounds . my last colonoscopy in jan 2015 was clear . i do soak my beans overnight for ease of cooking . maybe i should be ccoking them in the soaking water instead of draining first ? great work , lance ! thanks for sharing . soaking is fine . i don ’ t think you can remove “ all ” of the phytates . there are still benefits to soaking and sprouting.does tofu from spouted soy have fewer phytates , and would it be easier to digest ? i have found some extra firm tofu hard to digest and am thinking sprouted tofu might be a better alternative.i would think so . i have not seen a study on sprouted tofu , but the fact sprouting can have a role in decreasing phytates would make sprouted soybeans a good choice.when i cook dry beans i use the pressure cooker . i cook a pound of beans in about 6 cups of water or veggie broth without soaking first . depending on the type of bean it takes about 35-40 minutes to go from dry to completely cooked . no worry about throwing out the nutrients in the soaking water and it ’ s quicker too.for convenience i prefer to eat canned black beans ( eden and others ) . in order to remove as much bpa and bps as possible before consuming i rinse off the black goo canned beans come packed in.am i losing any significant bean nutrition this way ? the beans themselves remain intact after cold water washing , ready to cook and eat.just a thought : if you ’ re putting the beans on / in a salad , maybe you could pour the liquid into a container to save for soup . i keep a container in my freezer into which i pour liquid from cooking veggies , etc . , and later i use same as soup stock since store-bought stock leaves something to be desired for me.no i do not think you are losing any nutrients . i recommend rinsing the beans to remove excess salt anyway : - ) i soak dried beans and then cook them . what do you recommend – soaking at room temperature for 12-24 hours or in the refrigerator ? i don ’ t soak . perhaps i should . i need a personal chef ! i use a crock pot when i make my own , but mostly eat canned or grandma ’ s beans if i am lucky enough to see her . i am human and get quite busy with work ; - ) my stomach handles them well never had a problem . other swear by soaking and i do not disagree with them.he mentioned using eden ’ s – no salt beans … . wouldn ’ t it be good to save the liquid for soups ? or is there a reason we should not ? yes . that is even better ! sure , you could save the liquid if it adds to your dishes . some people like the garbanzo bean juice for their home-made hummus . totally up to you ! beans , beans , the american fruit . the more you eat the more you toot . the more you toot , the better you feel . so let ’ s have beans at every meal . lol ! there are many countries with a lower prevalence of colon cancer than finland. http : / / www.worldlifeexpectancy.com / cause-of-death / colon-rectum-cancers / by-country / the endocrine disrupting bpa / bps would have leeched into the liquid from the can lining . save it ? that ’ s why i discard it.how about eden ’ s ? eden went bpa-free in their can liners but likely substituted it with bps , which may be worse.i ’ m so glad that i found a person like dr michael greger ! i ’ m a paramedic who used to work in polish medical system . i was astonish how ignorant medical doctors and my colegues was – in terms of food-influence knlowdge . we were perfectly trained in performing resuscytation and other methods of sustaining life at the edge – but none of us were trained in prevention of theese dieseases which caused those states we were struggling with our bare hands as an outcome … i ’ ve sent myself hundrets of people after cardiac intervention to hospitals and later on – to homes – and that was a death sentence for this patients , and i truly regret that i didn ’ t had the knowledge to help and support them in terms of dietetics after cardiac indicents – back then , when i was a part of the medical system . i have some blood on my hands … thank you , mr . greger – and thanks for your whole team . great work you ’ re doing . i truly respect you for that.in another video , dr. greger said that each 20 gram serving of beans reduces our risk of death by 8 percent . in another video , he shows that the best bean is black beans.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-best-bean-2 / it is clear that beans may be the most important dietary factor in life extension , more so than nuts by a slim margin . there is a bean nut , the peanut , and a bean tea , red tea or green red tea . beans can add profoundly to life and improve the lifes of people who eat them down the road.beans should be eaten daily to promote health.i read that beets are important for a healthy colon , based on the centenarians in russia who eat borscht.i translated the article into portuguese and republished . i hope this awareness on health and nutrition can grow , along with the nutritionfacts.org community , and spread in the portuguese speaking world . thank you all for being there. http : / / focoempatico.net / prevencao-do-cancro-do-colon-e-da-fibra-ou-dos-fitatos / do you soak beans before cooking ? what effect does that have on phytates ? hi julien . i touch on this further down in the thread , here . thanks for your question.i have a concern regarding hospital food . my general comment is that they give people the food that in most cases put them here in the first place . specifically , my son has been here at johns hopkins hospital in rehab from surgery for a tumor . the wound from the surgery is healing “ too slowly ” which is an issue because he can not due chemotherapy until the wound heals . so , they sent around a nutritionist and he said simply , “ as many calories as you can eat , and you need a lot of protein to heal . ” he gave us no menu . at this point , let me state my prejudice : like dr. greger ’ s grandma , i found nathan pritikin , after having a chest pain . i did not go to the clinic but i read his book . that was 40 years ago . i am now 71 and take no medications and run five miles every day ( slowly ) . i don ’ t eat meat and hardly ever eat any animal products and until recently ( after watching dr. gerger ’ s video regarding vitamin b12 ) . i eat brown rice and beans and tofu almost every night . i am , obviously , not dead . okay , here is the problem : i have been ordering my son veggie burgers , tofu and rice ( they do not offer beans ! ) , oatmeal , and , to hedge my bets , salmon , which has been available about every third day . we have been here for six weeks . the staff has put a lot of pressure on me and i have caved somewhat , ordering chicken and turkey and low cholesterol eggs . i do not know why more protein has to mean more meat . also , i just read , dr. servan -schreiber ’ s book “ anti-cancer ” and he offers tons of data suggesting that meat stimulate the growth of a tumor . my son ’ s tumor could not be completely excised , and it could come back , and has come back once already . jhh is arguably one of the greatest hospitals in the world . i know that i am right , and i have the science , but i do not want to risk my son ’ s life because of my experience prejudicing my choices for his meals . and , by the way , patients at adventist hospital with a veggie diet must heal , no ? any thoughts would be appreciated.your options must be very limited , and you have done a great job with what you have available . the most anti-cancer foods according to this site include : nuts : walnuts , pecans , and peanuts veggies : beets , kale , garlic , broccoli. carrots fruit : cranberries , lemons , apples spices : tumeric , rosemary , ginger tea : hibiscus , white with lemon , and matcha berries : blueberry , barberry , goji berry , and strawberry nori , white button mushrooms , flax seed , and amla are also recommended.dr. hoffer has followed several doctors in finding that large doses of vitamins can greatly improve cancer outcomes . he recommends vitamin c , niacin , vitamin e , vitamin a , folic acid , essential fatty acids , selenium , and zinc.are you allowed to bring in your own food ? you could bring in some trail mix made with these ingredients . dr. greger on this site said that the effect of tumeric on cancer was limited to how much you could take.dr. hoffer wrote a small book , user ’ s guide to natural therapies for cancer prevention and control where he outlined many people who did quite well using vitamins in addition to their regular chemotherapy , he cites 40 percent survival after ten years . with nutrition and orthomolecular vitamin therapy , you should be in the best shape possible . could you bring in your own vitamins ? do doctors there object ? you should like you are picking the best foods from the menu . is your son allowed to sit near a window ? vitamin d3 , made from sunlight , is very powerful against some cancers.good luck.hello again cleo1943 . there are almost 500 studies going on right now to see if high d3 ( 50,000 iu or so in some ) are good for cancer , to see if it could be a treatment and a cure . the companies sponsoring this research are reasonably sure it is a good treatment . d3 can ’ t be regulated by the federal government , so you can be in the study yourself without reporting.you can read about this herehttp : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2011 / 08 / 06 / why-we-dont-have-a-cure-for-cancer-yet-or-do-we.aspxor see the clinical trials here.https : / / clinicaltrials.gov / ct2 / results ?

is it that he is not meeting protein needs ? i cannot imagine receiving more pressure in an already pressured ( understatement of the year ) situation . often our hands are tied when it comes to “ hospital food ” so consider options for bringing in food or making sure fresh fruits and veggies are available . i can bet the hospital has a salad bar and for good heavens let ’ s write a letter to john hopkins so they can stock kidney beans in the salad bar ! let me know if i can be of more help.warm wishes , joseph cancer , chicken , chickpeas , colon cancer , colon health , dna damage , dr. denis burkitt , fiber , fish , grains , iron , lentils , meat , nuts , oxidative stress , phytates , phytic acid , plant-based diets , poultry , processed foods , red meat , split peas , standard american diet , turkey , uganda , vegans , vegetarians , white meat - -
19	low carb diets found to feed heart disease people going on low carb diets may not see a rise in their cholesterol levels . how is that possible ? because weight loss by any means can drop our cholesterol . we could go on an all-twinkie diet and lower our cholesterol as long as we didn ’ t eat too many . a good cocaine habit could do it . anything that drops our weight can drop our cholesterol , but the goal isn ’ t to fit into a skinnier casket ; the reason we care about cardiovascular risk factors like cholesterol is because we care about cardiovascular risk , the health of our arteries . now we have studies that measure the impact of low carb diets on arteries directly , and a review of all the best studies to date found that low-carb diets impair arterial function , as evidenced by a decrease in flow-mediated dilation , meaning low-carb diets effectively stiffen people ’ s arteries . and since that meta-analysis was published , a new study found the same thing : “ a dietary pattern characterized by high protein and fat , but low carbohydrate was associated with poorer peripheral small artery function , ” again measuring blood flow into people ’ s limbs . but peripheral circulation is not as important as the circulation in the coronary arteries that feed our heart . there has only been one study ever done measuring actual blood flow to the heart muscles of people eating low-carb diets . dr. richard fleming , an accomplished nuclear cardiologist , enrolled 26 people into a comprehensive study of the effects of diet on cardiac function using the latest in nuclear imaging technology – so-called spect scans , enabling him to actually directly measure the blood flow within the coronary arteries . he then put them all on a healthy vegetarian diet , and a year later the scans were repeated . by that time , however , ten of the patients had jumped ship onto the low carb bandwagon . at first i bet he was disappointed , but surely soon realized he had an unparalleled research opportunity dropped into his lap . here he had extensive imaging of ten people before and after following a low carb diet and 16 following a high carb diet . what would their hearts look like at the end of the year ? we can talk about risk factors all we want , but compared to the veg group , did the coronary heart disease of the patients following the atkins-like diets improve , worsen , or stay the same ? those sticking to the vegetarian diet showed a reversal of their heart disease as expected . their partially clogged arteries literally got cleaned out . they had 20 % less atherosclerotic plaque in their arteries at the end of the year than at the beginning . what happened to those who abandoned the treatment diet , and switched over to the low-carb diet ? their condition significantly worsened . 40 % to 50 % more artery clogging at the end of the year . in heart scans of the patients , as seen in my video , low carb diets and coronary blood flow , the yellow and particularly red areas represent blood flow through the coronary arteries to the heart muscle . the scan of one of the patients who went on a plant-based diet , shows how their arteries opened right up increasing the blood flow . another person , however , started out with good flow , but after a year on a low-carb diet , they significantly clogged down their arterial blood flow . so this is the best science we have , demonstrating the threat of low-carb diets , not just measuring risk factors , but actual blood flow in people ’ s hearts on different diets . of course the reason we care about cardiac blood flow , is we don ’ t want to die . another meta-analysis was recently published that finally went ahead and measured the ultimate end-point , death , and low-carb diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality , meaning living a significantly shorter lifespan . the reason i have so few videos about low-carb diets is that i already wrote a book about it . carbophobia is now available free online full-text at atkinsfacts.org. atkins ’ lawyers threatened to sue , leading to a heated exchange you ’ re sure to enjoy that i reprint in the book . i did touch on it atkins diet : trouble keeping it up , though low carb diets don ’ t necessarily have to be that unhealthy ( see my video plant-based atkins diet ) . here are some videos i ’ ve done on conquering our # 1 killer : dr greger , i just wanted to thank you for all your hard work , yours is the best website in the universei second that aneta . this has to be the most revolutionary site on health ever created ! ! it is my # 1 go-to source … my health bible ! i refer videos to friends and acquaintances with tumors and cancer . humanity deserves this knowledge . .. after that it ’ s up to each individual whether they will follow it or not ! ! ! i ’ m curious if there are any studies comparing vegetarian / vegan diets to low carb / normal protein / high fat , as this is the diet currently touted by the paleo crowd . it seems that the high fat diets in the study were atkins diets , high in both animal protein and fat . what about moderate animal protein / high fat ? no no no , paleo does not mean “ high fat ” . paleo and atkins , or at least the old atkins , are not the same at all . most plaeo advocates define their diet as high in low starch veggies , small amount of low fat protein , small “ healthy ” fats ( avocado , olive oil , monounsaturated fats ) some seeds & nuts , no processed foods , no added sugars , legumes or processed wheat , and a small amount of fruit.sounds pretty healthy , but why would a paleo diet have extracted oils ? i was at whole foods the other day and saw the ingredient list for a paleo item and it also had olive oil.well , i guess there are no hard & stringent rules to what “ paleo ” actually is . but you ’ re correct , any extracted oil shouldn ’ t be paleo , nor should any processed foods / meats such as bacon , jerky , etc . , but some say it is . the term paleo used by many to define a diet is pretty much a misnomer , and admittingly , i ’ m not an expert.dr. david jenkins helped invent the glycemic index . he developed a portfolio diet for lowering cholesterol . one study he was part of looked at the difference between a vegan and omnivorous low-carb diet , as seen in this video . i do not necessarily recommend it because i have seen excellent clinical results from a strict plant based diet higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat , but still this ‘ eco-atkins ’ type of diet shows that perhaps animal fat is very different from plant fat.use coconut oil for most of your fats . it is true , my cholesterol has gone up from eating too much processed meat.there is not just one “ paleo diet . ” there are many interpretations.there is – sort of.http : / / www.nejm.org / doi / full / 10.1056 / nejmoa0708681while not a true veg diet , it was close in that is was a low fat calorie restricted with fat being only 30 % of calories and saturated fat 10 % . that arm of the trial had women and men eating 1500 or 1800 calories , respectively . so that means for a man only 180 calories would come from sat fat which would be only 20 grams . so that would have precluded eating very much meat or dairy. the other arms were the mediterranean and low carb diets.in all measures the low carb beat the mediterrranean which beat the low fat.there are other studies as well but not as rigourous , but pretty much every diet tested against a low fat diet wins.the best part of this study is that food was provided to the participants at noon ( the main meal of the day in isreal ) , it lasted 2 years and there was a very high complaince rate ( 95 % year 1 and 84 % year 2 ) .btw , low carb diets , such as atkins , are not high protein.the are high fat ( 60-80 % ) with very low carb and modearte protein.the paleo diet that was origianlly developed to mimic what our ancestors ate for millions of years has sort of morphed into a low fat no wheat or sugar type of diet.they tend to be higher in protein with the suggestion being to eat only lean meats , i suspect because of the lingering fear of fat . so the claim that his diet is what out ancestors ate for million of years calearly is not correct . for as we know from indigenous peoples such as the inuit and others , who routinley eat meat that had the most fat first and then the rest and then feed to leanest meats to the dogs . also if we look at all carnivorous animals , we find that after the kill the first thing they go for are the viscera often leaving the the muscular parts to the vultures.also with the current paleo idea as to what we ate , it ’ s hard to imagine how our ancestors survived on tubers and plants , etc for example in the norther hemispher fot the 6 months or so when you couldn ’ t grow anything . and as for olive oil and other oils , they are realtively recent inclusions to our diet . for example , read about the myth of olive oil having been consume for centuries.dr. greger , i ’ d be thrilled to see some data and suggestions on increasing blood flow to the brain for those who have had tbi / concussions , especially for young adults with history of concussions from sports . apparently the increased blood flow to brain helps damaged brain tissue heal . sure , one could cut back on fat and add berries . but your data is fun ! hi leslie . interesting thought ! i searched for increased blood flow and concussions but nothing was relevant on diet . if i find more i ’ ll be sure to post.does low carb necessarily mean high meat-based protein and high fat ? what i ’ m asking is what did these people on the low carb diet actually eat ? if they ate veggies and fruits instead of starches , then this study would be astonishing . but if they ate lots of meat-based protein and fat , then this study doesn ’ t tell us anything new at all.exactly. how is “ low carb ” defined in reference to this study ? good points . it is hard to say what the low-carb diet consisted of . i ’ ll look deeper into this . you can too by checking out the actual study . dr. mentions how the diet was supposed to be a healthy vegetarian diet , but then 10 folks went on a low-carb diet . from the methods : “ each patient was advised to consume a diet consisting of 10 kcal / pound / day . on the basis of caloric calculations , patients were instructed to consume 15 % of their daily calories in protein , 70 % in carbohydrate ( principally complex carbohydrates ) , and 15 % in fat with a 2 : 1 ratio of nonsaturated ( polyunsaturated , monosaturated ) to saturated fat intake . for example , a 170-pound person would be instructed to eat 1,700 calories per day , including 255 calories from protein ( 64 grams ) , 1,190 calories from carbohydrates ( 297 grams ) from a variety of ( mostly complex ) carbohydrates , and 255 calories fat ( 28 grams ) , of which no more than 9 grams could be saturated . ” at any rate , this dietary pattern seemed to trump the low-carb diet.here ’ s a link to the new study which found an association between low carb and poorer peripheral small artery function. http : / / journals.cambridge.org / download.php ? file = % 2fbjn % 2fbjn109 _ 07 % 2fs0007114512003091a.pdf & code = 3b0134193b14a1741e3a1a9fe14560df the study was conducted in spain , but the study authors noted that “ the diet consumed by the present study population was similar to the diet of a corresponding american population with equally high cv risk ” . it was based on a 3-day food intake evaluation and reduced to a low-carbohydrate score . guess they weren ’ t following the mediterranean diet , but instead the good ’ ol american sad.a newer review http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4418418 / questioned whether low-carb diets have a favorable or detrimental impact on endothelial function , or is it the quality of the carbs which matters . they commented that high carbohydrate diets which cause hyperglycemia have been demonstrated to worsen the efficacy of the endothelial system and are associated with an increased cvd risk . a limitation to the studies analyzing low carb diets is that the carbs must be replaced by fats and protein , and it can be “ challenging to differentiate the effect of carbohydrate restriction from the effects due to alterations in other macronutrients ” . they observed that low-carb diets are associated with decreased intake of fiber , fruit or root vegetables , and increased consumption of meat and dairy , which may contribute to the adverse vascular outcomes . this review concluded that emphasizing the quality and gi index of foods may be a more promising approach to preserving vascular function than low-carb.however , the eco-atkins diet , which is low-carb vegan , has been shown to be associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates . david jenkins published this study http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4418418 / which used nuts as a replacement for carbs . the full-nut dose of 73 g / day ( 2.6 oz ) reduced a1c , ldl , and apob with good compliance among the participants with the diet . this is the diet i follow which has helped me drop my a1c to 5.0 , total cholesterol to 145 , ldl particles down to 668 , inflammation markers low , and bmi fine . i think my success with this low-carb plan is from using high quality , whole plant foods and low gi carbs.what about those of us vegans who eat a lot of nuts , avocados , seeds , and tofu , but virtually no carbs and zero animal products ? my diet is about 40 % fat , but only the veggie kind . so far , no heart or vascular disease , low homocysteine and crp . the reason for low-carbs ? unfortunately , i ’ m pre-diabetic and even whole grains raise my glucose excessively ( even though i ’ m quite thin ) .hey russell , a high carb plant diet does not cause diabetes , in fact dr. neal barnard ’ s patients managed to reverse their type-2 diabetes by eating as much as they cared for of fruits , veggies , grains , legumes etc . diabetes is a disease of fat toxicity as dr. gregor has taught us in previous videos . i would recommend cutting your fat intake way down to no more than 10 % of your calories . try to aim for 80-10-10 for optimal health . ( carbs-protein-fat ) . use cronometer.com for an excellent look into your diets macro / micro nutrient breakdown . raw till 4 high-carb , low fat for the win ! ! people who do not have this problem are always quick to recommend this sort of thing . i also note that the doctors pushing this approach do not have such problems themselves — if i am wrong here please direct me to one who does . unfortunately , i also suffer from carb sensitivity due to a medical mistake and the fact is that , like others with blood sugar regulation issues , too many carbs dangerously elevates my post-prandial glucose levels . intelligent use of supplements , exercise , and a moderately low carb diet have kept me from slipping into any diagnosed disease — in fact , most doctors would now laugh at my concerns based simply on fasting blood sugars — but i work hard . i would love to reduce fat content and eat more carbs but given my observations based upon extensive blood monitoring i do not see how it could possibly work.one problem with these studies is the confounding of animal products with “ low carb ” and , as the doctor points out , at least one study showed that a vegan low carb diet ( eco atkins ) can be healthy ( though it was a bit high in processed soy for my taste ) . and btw , i do support a vegan diet approach so i am on his side in that respect.finally , while i cannot claim to have read every study on fat metabolism and diabetes , every one i have read involves obese patients . so i always have the question about how this applies to fit folks who otherwise appear to have normal fat metabolism . i am pretty fit and can eat nearly 4,000 calories a day on a lower carb diet without gaining weight at a certain point . that is on a diet of approximately 60 % fat.steven , thanks for the comments . we have similar issues , and i ’ m up to 60 % plant-based fats on some days as well . like steve bozic above , who clearly means well , there is a lot of ignorance in the community about what thin vegan diabetics or pre-diabetics should do . it ’ s also frustraging to see so much conflation between low-carb animal diets and low-carb plant-based diets . there are extremely different ! ! ( yes , have seen jenkins ’ excellent work supporting plant-based fats , and higher fat levels in general ) .for that reason , three of us from nutrition facts have taken our conversations off-line and we compare notes and send around interesting studies and articles on a weekly basis . feel free to join us if you want . i ’ m at russelllong @ me.com. yes , we are all basically eco-atkins.i ’ ve had a few emails with caroline trapp who runs the diabetes program for dr. neal barnard , and she finally admitted that there is virtually no data on thin diabetics , and recognizes that it presents a different set of problems since we don ’ t have insulin resistance and instead appear to have insulin production problems , and you need a lot of insulin to metabolize carbs , whole grain or otherwise . ( not so much for veggie fats or protein . ) here ’ s the question regarding eco-atkins : at higher veggie fat intakes , i find my ldl can climb to 138 . at the lowest fat intake that i can get to while still keeping a1c under 5.5 , i get about 35 % of calories from fat and my ldl drops to 95 . but wow , at those lower levels , its hard to stay over 140 lbs , , and i ’ m 5 ’ 10 ” . finding the middle ground between getting too skinny and having excessive ldl is very challenging.thanks , steve ! from dr. barnard ’ s research , study participants received either a low-fat vegan diet or a typical diet for diabetes and found significant changes in weight loss and insulin levels . dr. greger presents the study in this video.steve , not sure if you saw my response below , and i appreciate the comments . i actually do use cronometer . i briefly got my fat to 10 % , while compensating for the lost calories with brown rice , whole oats , etc . , but my glucose went crazy and the docs were threatening to put me on insulin . unfortunately , greger / barnard ’ s approach just doesn ’ t work for thin people with diabetic-type issues . we ’ re clearly in the minority though , and heavier people should definitely go with the greger program.anyway , my a1c is happily under 5.5 now , and the docs are not concerned about my glucose so long as i keep it there.well , heavy or thin , it just doesnt work for some . i cannot get weight down while concentrating on carbs . it doesnt matter if its mostly complex .. the insulin resistance may play a part. contrary to popular belief .. we can be very active people , but carbs of any kind wreak havochey becky . have you tried a raw till 4pm high fruit diet yet ? it will reverse insulin resistance . here ’ s what i eat in a day – what i eat in a day – my smoothie recipe : approx . 2500cal ( gets me to approx 4pm daily ) . macronutrient breakdown of roughly 80 % carbs / 10 % protein / 10 % fat . ( which is ideal for optimal health ) 250ml of soy / almond chocolate milk ( almost all brands b12 fortified ) 20 pitted dates handful or two of spinach ( or kale ) 1 teaspoon of “ ceylon ” cinnamon ( not the common kind found in most stores ) 1.5 tablespoons of chia powder 1.5 tablespoons of hemp seeds optional 1 fresh indian gooseberry ( left in the fridge to soak over night in water ) 1 apple 2 kiwis ( if available ) 1 handful of dried or fresh cranberries ( if available ) or 1 handful of dried or fresh figs ( if available ) 1 tablespoon coconut sugar ( optional for taste ) 6-8 bananas depending on size ( super ripe with tons of brown spots if possible ) fill blender rest of the way with water ( i ’ ll also sometimes sprout broccoli seeds and throw a handful in ) then for dinner it ’ s a cooked carb rotation between pasta / potatoes / rice / quinoa with mixed veggies ( mainly broccoli ) and tomato sauce.this daily diet when checked on cronometer.com meets all of the vitamin / mineral as well as fat / protein / carb requirements for optimal health.wow. no , thats way more than i eat . any addition of fruit or veg , besides , besides s bit of ight salad fare , seem to count as sugar . kale ( strange ) even gave me a couple lbs. when i review how those with insulin resistance seem to have all go to fat storage if not used right away , it sees accurate . i am active , eat clean for the most part , and rarely consume over 2000 kcal in a day . the oy way i have evet lost weight was by extreme exercise ( zumba-way fun ! ) and eliminating most carb . because so many are as confused , as i am , i am now studying nutrition. lower carb rates can cause troble with memory and other issues with the brain . when i put more carbs back in my diet ( mostly vegetable , but some fruit ) , i felt more awake , just as the rd tlod me . by no means am i a young pup , so a little brain fog ( and with heart and muscle conditions as well … i ’ m complicated . im only told to gind a way to lose weight . no direction gor me , except my new rd . i cant imagine all that fruit would help me . i do add chia and flax seed , alternating , fish oil and vit d ( mine was a little low ) . yes , the ceylon cinnamon is used often , as is garlic and turmeric … yes , right in my greek yogurt ! savory , and quite tasty with some homemade balsamic vinegrette ! i eat some berry every day too. somehow , my blood sugars have been low , but i still gain . doesnt help that i needed a steroid treatment to get my legs going last fall.sorry about the spelling . its on my phone today , a bit harder for me sometimesif your issue is that you have insulin resistance the only real cure is to cut out all animal foods as the saturated fat and cholesterol in them is causing your disease . yours is a disease of “ fat toxicity ” as dr. gregor has done a few videos on in the past few months . once you cut out all animal foods ( meat , dairy and eggs ) as well as oils , and other overtly fatty foods and replace them with an abundance of fruits daily then and only then will you cure yourself of the insulin resistance issues you are troubled with . you should use chronometer.com to make sure you are meeting all of your micronutrient requirements as well . potassium is the key to weight loss . not sure if you know this but 98 % of americans do not get enough potassium daily.glad you found something that works , that is the what ’ s important ! hey russell . here ’ s the key . long term results . i know you ’ ve got your issues under control now eating that much plant based fat but have you tried to go “ fruit-based ” “ raw till 4pm ” freelee the banana girl style yet ? it ’ s been super successful for most even slim , active people that are at risk for type-2 diabetes . i say give it a shot for a few weeks at least . smash in the bananas brah . peace and love.i can eat about two bites or banana before my glucose exceeds the speed limit . or about a quarter of an apple . i wish it could work … i love fruit but other than a strawberry or two sometimes , they ’ re off my list.i second russell ’ s comments . for instance , you frequently see recommendations to eat berries as a “ low glycemic ” fruit but my experience as been that even small amounts ( like picking blackberries as you walk through the woods here in the pnw ) elevate my glucose , and it sounds like russell has much bigger problems than i do . i ’ ll stick with emphasizing the vegetables.russell. i saw your earlier response and am interested – i will contact you soon.interesting conversation , at any rate ! i have similar reactions but could probably manage 1 banana and an apple and no more . i also find coffee has a negative effect , after about 30mins-1hr . when i used to eat biscuits before going plant based whole food , anything containing golden syrup or corn syrup also gave me problems , similar to the effects of msg in some processed food.steve , your advice would kill russell . freelee and durian rider are fraudsters.hey russell , a high carb plant diet does not cause diabetes , in fact dr. neal barnard ’ s patients managed to reverse their type-2 diabetes by eating as much as they cared for of fruits , veggies , grains , legumes etc . diabetes is a disease of fat toxicity as dr. gregor has taught us in previous videos . i would recommend cutting your fat intake way down to no more than 10 % of your calories . try to aim for 80-10-10 for optimal health . ( carbs-protein-fat ) . use cronometer.com for an excellent look into your diets macro / micro nutrient breakdown . raw till 4 high-carb , low fat for the win ! ! good question . you may want to check out some of dr. jenkins ’ s work . dr. david jenkins helped invent the glycemic index . he developed a portfolio diet for lowering cholesterol . here are 38 citations about diet and disease with this one showing tree nuts help improve glycemic control . nuts and seeds appear helpful for those with diabetes . vegans on a low-carb diet ate nuts / seeds and seemed to do okay , as seen in this video on a low-carb plant-based diet . click “ source cited ” to find the actual study , if interested . i do not necessarily recommend it because i have seen excellent clinical results from a strict plant based diet higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat , but still this ‘ eco-atkins ’ type of diet shows that perhaps animal fat is very different from plant fat.thanks dr. gonzales . i am aware of some of the research on nuts but not all and will follow up these links . it is clear from many sources , including dr. gregor ’ s videos , that walnuts may be the best attested “ super food ” out there . in any event , i eat a fairly large amount of nuts and seeds and they have been key to making it work for me.please see russell ’ s response to me above . i always thought that blood sugar spikes were fine and of no threat to the organs as long as the levels were brought down to a safe level within a few hours . mine can spike up 175 after a bowl of fruit , but as long as i move around and exercise it comes down 2 or 3 hours later . i always was told this was safe , but the studies russel posted claim otherwise . your thoughts ? hi leslie . sure i ’ ll look into , but i don ’ t see a study ? can you find me a link for reference ? thanks ! joseph , here is a link to a study which found that post-meal glucose spikes above 140 are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease , both in nondiabetic and diabetic people . abstract http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12796066 full article http : / / ccs01.vo.ca-cncx.net / o41 / 5507 / bw / bs / fpcr20080006 / articles / la7d.pdfmany thanks for sharing that link . looks like under 140 mg / dl may be optimal . the standard of medical care in diabetes 2015 mentions < 180 mg / dl . i think the lower the number the better . again , thanks 's for sharing that important study.when you say “ whole grains raise my glucose excessively ” what are you considering a high glucose reading ? how long does it stay that high ? does it eventually come down a few hours later ? thank you for clarity , this might help me.studies show that above 140 , organ damage can begin to occur . i try always to stay below 140 . unfortunately that means that if i have a half cup of oatmeal , i exceed that number by quite a bit and will stay above 140 for 2-3 hours unless i go for a walk right away . instead i substantially reduce my oatmeal amount and add flaxseed , almond butter , hemp seeds . these reduce the peak considerably and also taste great ! thanks for the studies . but i am confused and now curious about something … as you claim that if you go for a walk after eating the oatmeal then the blood sugar issue is no longer an issue , as this obviously keeps your blood reading at a safe level , of no harm , but you instead you add nuts and seeds in place of the oatmeal , and this , i am to assume , allows you not to have to go for the walk . why not just eat the oatmeal and exercise ? it seems so natural , like the “ human ” thing to do , to be on our feet , active before and after exercise . am i understanding this correctly ? it would take a one hour walk to hold glucose down to sub 140 . i just don ’ t have the time and need to get to work . but you are on the right track ; if one has time for extended walks after each meal every day , some carbs can definitely be added.i eat meat so can distinguish between low cabo and high protean.the experiment does not mean low carbo no good .. it just means high protean no good.i believe dr. greger has reviewed studies comparing animal protein to plant protein and plant protein doesn ’ t have the same negative effects as animal.you are correct . dr. greger has a blog about the ratio of animal vs. plant protein and cancer . you can view his video in that blog , too . thanks , amanda.i couldn ’ t find the free download of carbophobia at atkinsfacts.orgdownload gives 404 but you can get the html one and then print to pdf. http : / / atkinsfacts.org / printer _ friendly.htmlthanks , mike ! hi susanna . you can read for free from the printer friendly version ( the link mike gave below ) . we ’ re working on fixing the pdf link . thanks ! lies . big vegetable oil companies producing “ research ” . dr. atkins diet has helped scores of patients , to lose weight and reduce cholesterol , and triglycerides . low fat and high carb diets have proven to increase weight , and to promote diabetes.you remind me of nina teicholz . i ’ m guessing you consider a diet getting about a third of its calories from fat and about half from carbohydrate to be “ low-fat ” and “ high-carb . ” one thing is , i ’ ve never seen a paper indicating an atkins-type diet having the kind of effect seen here. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4338379 / read dr. atkin ’ s diet revolution.read carbophobia.here is a excerpt : there is nothing new or revolutionary about dr. atkins new diet revolution . various high-fat diet fads like atkins have been masquerading under different names for over a hundred years , starting in 1864 when an english undertaker and coffin maker by the name of william banting wrote a book called letter on corpulence .

20	how curry can kill cancer cells it is estimated that the human body consists of ten or so trillion cells . almost all of these cells get turned over within approximately 100 days . that means we ’ re like a new person every three months . we reinvent ourselves physically . and since we ’ re physically made of air , water , and food — those are essentially the only inputs — we are what we eat , literally and physically . in a sense our body has to rebuild itself every three months with the building materials we deliver to it through our stomach . our mouths are like the access road to the continual construction site of our body . trucks roll in three times a day . what do we want them to deliver ? some shoddy cheap stuff we scrounged around for or bought at the discount outlets that ’ s just going to fall apart ? or do we want to build our foundation solid ? we are each walking inside the greatest known architectural structures in the universe . let ’ s not ruin such grand blueprints by consuming junk . we only own the biological real estate we ’ re born with , so if we need to rebuild every three months , we also need a wrecking crew . if we ’ re replacing ten trillion cells every hundred days , that means we have to kill off about 100 billion cells every day . out with the old , in with the new . we do that primarily through “ apoptosis , ” pre-programmed cell death ( from the greek ptosis , meaning “ falling ” , and apo , “ away from ” ) . for example , we all used to have webbed fingers and toes . literally . each one of us did in the womb until about four months , when apoptosis kicked in , and the cells in the webbing kill themselves off to separate our fingers . however , some cells overstay their welcome : cancer cells . they don ’ t die when they ’ re supposed to by somehow turning off their suicide genes . what can we do about that ? well , one of the ways the yellow pigment in curry powder kills cancer cells is by reprogramming the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells . let me just run through one of these pathways . fas is a so-called death receptor that activates the fas associated death domain , death receptor five , and death receptor four . the fadd associated death domain then activates caspase-8 , which “ ignites the death machine , ” and kills the cell . ( to see the diagram of the pathway , go to my video turmeric curcumin reprogramming cancer cell death ) . where does curry powder fit into all this ? in cancer cells , curcumin , the pigment in the spice turmeric that makes curry powder yellow , upregulates and activates death receptors ( as shown in human kidney cancer cells , skin cancer cells , and nose and throat cancer cells ) . curcumin can also activate the death machine directly ( as shown in lung cancer and colon cancer ) . caspases are so-called “ executioner enzymes , ” that when activated , destroy the cancer cell from within by chopping up proteins left and right — kind of like death by a thousand cuts . and that ’ s just one pathway . curcumin can also affect apoptosis in a myriad other ways , affecting a multitude of different types of cancer cells . it also tends to leave normal cells alone for reasons that are not fully understood . overall , researchers “ showed that curcumin can kill a wide variety of tumor cell types through diverse mechanisms . and because curcumin can affect numerous mechanisms of cell death at the same time , it ’ s possible that cancer cells may not easily develop resistance to curcumin-induced cell death like they do to most chemotherapy . ” for more on turmeric and cancer , check out back to our roots : curry and cancer and carcinogen blocking effects of turmeric . other herbs and spices such as garlic and amla have similar selective effects against cancer cell ( see # 1 anticancer vegetable and some ayurvedic medicine worse than lead paint exposure ) . i talk more about this concept of “ apoptosis , ” programmed cell death in : what else can turmeric do ? here ’ s the videos i have so far ( with more on the way ! ) : this is fascinating stuff . thanks for all your videos and articles , which keep me motivated to stay away from sad . bring on the curry , sambar , shiro , and other yummy turmeric laden peasant foods.check out this simple turmeric concoction . i dissolve it into sauces and dressings and use it with steamed-sauteed vegetables. http : / / eatandbeatcancer.com / 2012 / 12 / 06 / anti-cancer-recipes-how-to-make-turmeric-more-potent-and-tasty / curcumin is also a powerful anti-cancer property for pets . dr. leilani alvarez explains : http : / / www.thehonestkitchen.com / blog / dietary-recommendations-cancer-recovery-dogs-cats / i ’ ve been adding a small 1.5 inch piece of raw turmeric root to my juice that i make each day . does juicing it raw provide the same benefits as eating it from spice / curry form ? i would think so , but from what i can tell these studies are conducted on dried powders . sometimes dried herbs and spices can be more concentrated , but that doesn ’ t mean the root ( the direct source ) would be a bad choice and i would expect the benefits from juicing turmeric root.thanks – hopefully the benefit is there . if you find any more details or have an idea on if i should use more please let me know.no problem ! thanks to julie for finding the video that i could not ! looks like fresh is fine : ) jg , dr greger ’ s video , “ boosting the bioavailability of curcumin ” , answers your question . fresh and dried turmeric both increase the absorption of curcumin . eating fat with turmeric increases the bioavailability even further. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin / perfect , maybe i ’ ll add a pinch of black pepper to my juice as well . thanks julie ! the raw turmeric helps with inflammation , but heat treated turmeric has dna strand protecting benefits that the raw does not . gregor had a video on that . try to cook with it too and get the best of both worlds.yes , i agree with ben . i personally add fresh turmeric to my green smoothies and add turmeric powder to my food ( esp when cooking millet and rice etc ) .no it doesn ’ t jg . turmeric / curcumin is not highly bioavailable by itself and it needs to be consumed with pepper or a fat for the body to properly use it . blend a juice from turmeric and coconut milk.hi aqiyl . i also include two tablespoons of fine ground flaxseed to my juice , maybe the fat from there would help . good idea , though to use coconut milk as part of a base for the juice or maybe do that in a smoothie instead.you might want to try the smoothie recipe : i call it my “ brain body energizer . : ) http : / / www.naturallifeenergy.com / goji-berry-curcumin-juice / fascinating . no doubt that a mostly plant based diet is the best . are there any known serious downsides to curcumin ? we have no problem recommending b12 , vitamin d and selenium as a supplement . would anybody here recommend curcumin as a supplement ? michael ? joseph ? dr dynamic ? others ? hmm not sure . as you probably know , dr. greger mentions who should not consume turmeric . i think if someone refuses to use the spice in cooking than perhaps taking a supplement ( or a capsule full of turmeric ) would be a good option . i just shoot a few tsps of turmeric powder into my mouth when i remember and call it a “ supplement ” but i don ’ t use the curcumin supplements and i have not recommend them.actually , our very own vegan dr. mcdougall has flat out sad that vitamin d supplements are harmful and should be avoided . he put it in writing.i ’ m wondering if green tea or other plant polyphenols have quite the same capacity , since my immune system is unfortunately overreactive to turmeric . also fasting seems to be very beneficial for a wide array of chronic health issues including cancer . lately i ’ ve been playing with fasting / green tea combo , it feels good , natural and easy .. green tea has so many benefits i could write a book here ! check out dr. greger ’ s resources . polyphenols are very important . the first video discusses how juicing our fruit may remove these important polyphenols . so yes if you cannot do turmeric there are so many other plant-foods that exhibit similar roles.that first paragraph is now my new email signature.while it may be true that cumin , turmeric kill cancer cells , it ’ s because they are toxic chemicals . unfortunately , anything that will kill cancer cells will also kill healthy cells . btw , these substances do not act on living cells . it ’ s the other way around as these substances are not under any type of intelligent control unlike the living body . they are just dumb chemicals.in his video , dr. greger says ” and here ’ s all the different types of cancer cells curcumin can kill , but it tends to leave normal cells alone for reasons that are not fully understood . overall , this review showed that curcumin can kill a wide variety of tumor cell types through diverse mechanisms . ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / turmeric-curcumin-reprogramming-cancer-cell-death / do you avoid all spices and most herbs ? i partly agree with your logic . spices are not meant to be ingested by humans . but what do you think of garlic and chives and onions ? are these act like toxic chemicals also ? you avoid these ? i don ’ t understand why spices aren ’ t meant to be ingested by humans ? they are plants with biological properties , like any other , and have been shown to have so many benefits over time . i realize everything is made up of chemicals , but toxins implies something that would poison and harm … we ’ ve been using them for eons for their benefits . what am i missing ? this is just my opinion , but the spices have inherent properties that kill things . they are a flavoring . sure , they have positive attributes , when someone is sick . not everyday or weekly substances to put in our bodies , in my opinion.don ’ t be fooled by the ‘ natural ’ argument . arsenic is natural but it will kill you . the truth of the matter is that technically you don ’ t want anything in or on your body that has a pharmacological result only nutritional . for that reason , most of your so called herbs are toxic and should be avoided . they are just unrefined drugs . people not knowing any better , have died from herbs and supplements so be careful ! just because some company puts something in a jar or tube and tells you how great it is , you should be ever vigilant . the reason drugs seemed to “ work ” is because they are toxic ! if you body is having an acute or chronic disease process and you take ‘ x ’ and the dis ease goes away , what ’ s really happened is your subconscious brain has to stop the dis ease repair / detox process and now attempt to neutralize whatever poison you ’ ve just ingested or rubbed into your skin as that becomes a higher priority because you ’ ve just poisoned yourself and that ’ s a threat to survival . so what should you do when you don ’ t feel good ? go to bed ! allow the dis ease to run it ’ s course and you ’ ll be fine . then you need to figure out what it is you ’ ve done that ’ s making the dis ease necessary in the first place and eliminate whatever that may be.sorry but your “ logic ” escapes me . food is medicine , as per hippocrates , all plants or anything we ingest have pharmacological effects … nutrition has pharmacological effects ! certainly not everything is beneficial , but the dose makes the poison , assigning a label like “ toxic ” to plants traditionally used to heal is arbitrary and meaningless in your example . should we avoid plants with oxalates , phytic acid , or any number of “ toxins ” when we know they also have benefits ? do you do a chemical assay of everything you ingest and know just how it affects your biology ? your theory of disease is pretty um , interesting too . so if you breathe pollution and get lung cancer , you can just blame yourself and go to bed ? okay.with all due respect – ideally you only want to ingest substances that have nutritional results , i.e. convertible to living matter . fruit is at the top of that list . and no dose does not make the poison . that ’ s a ridiculous medical concept . a substance is either a food or a poison , poison defined as not convertible to living cells , therefore whatever it is is an irritant . as for dose , a poison is a poison regardless of dose – if it ’ s a small dose , it ’ s a small amount of poison ; if it ’ s a large amount , it ’ s a large amount of poison . plants don ’ t heal anything , only the living organism can do that , but because what you ’ re referring to is symptom suppression , yes certain plants with pharmacological effects do indeed suppress symptoms but since acute and chronic symptoms are right action completely under the control and direction of the subconscious brain , suppressing symptoms would be like if you had to defecate but instead of voiding you stuck a cork up your rectum to stop the “ symptom ” . and yes we should avoid plants with phytic and oxalic acids or , at the least should minimize them . yes spinach , kale and chard have lots of nutrients but they also have oxalic acid so it should not be dietary staple . you can get all the same mineral benefits from romaine lettuce without the oxalic acid . i have had patients with lung difficulties that , as a part of their health remediation process , moved from where they were living where air pollution was high to places with clean air because it was important enough to them to do that . they understood that health is only produced by healthful living.i don ’ t make the rules , mother nature does . one of the rules is that whatever substance you ’ re referring to , if you cannot make a mono meal off of it , it ’ s not really a food for us . if you attempted to eat nothing but curry or cumin , you would be in for a rude awakening . unfortunately garlic , contrary to popular belief , is definitely toxic and some of its chemical components are used in chemical warheads . onions , of course , is what tear gas is made from so it ’ s an irritant too . surely you ’ ve chopped into an onion and had some of the volatile gases get into the air and into your eyes . i ’ m not saying i don ’ t like their flavor , i do , but what we ’ re discussing here is if they are toxic or not . having said all the above , the good news is that if you ’ re going to cheat with garlic and onions , if you sauteed them , much of their volatile gases are cooked off so they are not nearly as toxic to you as when eaten raw . just don ’ t stick your head over the pan when sauteing as you will choke . when used in warfare , these chemicals when breathed in cause blistering of the lungs and death by suffocation within probably less than a minute . pretty gruesome huh.i do avoid most spices . i use a little oregano and garlic salt in stir frys and i use to use red pepper but like salt , it ’ s majorly toxic and was actually causing dis ease symptoms . since eliminating pepper , i no longer have the symptoms so it ’ s worth it ! i eliminated salt years ago as well as the other ‘ whites ’ – white flour , refined sugar , dairy , refined rice.most lack of eases people experience are due to what they put in their bodies , other lifestyle factors and not caused by viruses , bacteria and other things too small to see . as long as one lives within our biological limitations and dictates , experiencing dis eases becomes rare . i began my journey into conscious living 27 years ago and can honestly say that i have not taken even as much as an aspirin since . so with the exception of a couple of recoverable accidents and routine dental cleanings , i have not been a very good medical customer . all my adult life , i have never had health insurance . the few accidents i ’ ve had , i paid for services out of my pocket . perhaps i ’ ve been lucky but i do try to be careful when doing things that could be dangerous.dr jack , with very little respect , you are a goof . turmeric and cumin , onions and garlic have been consumed multiple times daily across the vast reaches of india , asia and africa with only beneficial effects . eat what you will but keep your harmful nonsense to yourself.another good curcumin read . i still drink mine in a cup of green tea with a dash of black pepper . that way i don ’ t have to add it to a food dish every day.just noticed frontine is doing a familiar story tonight . “ the spread of pathogens in chicken ” and why the food safety hasn ’ t stopped it.they must be getting ideas from watching dr g ’ s videos … : ) so what is the right way to eat turmeric powder ? do we add it to the oil or do we add it to the preparation without frying in oil ? i use turmeric powder everyday and use it both ways . i use it in my dals where i add it to the water directly , while in vegetable preparations i sometimes add it to the oil . so what is the right method . thx.hi joseph gonzales , do you think doctor greger could comment about the effects of curcumin on amyloid protein in the brain ? ? clinical psychiatrist dr tim jennings of http : / / www.comeandreason.com has alot to say about this and its benefitswyman – please if you are putting in a link – link to the article / video you are referencing not to the home page with no way to know where what you are talking about is . thanks.i eat turmeric almost every day . it ’ s one of my treatment . i think it ’ s working very well for me . no any side effects , i feel better and better everyday . i ’ m so glad that i didn ’ t choose chemo and radiation to treat my cancer . thank you so much dr. greger . people live with knowledge , i believe that the knowledge dr. gregor teach us , not only for prevent the diseases , it ’ s also treating the diseases . only key is don ’ t give up , just keep up , god bless everyone ! jojo , i am using turmeric to treat breast cancer . i , too , am not using conventional medicine . did you elect to have surgery ! whats the best way to eat turmeric , in powder form or fresh root form and how much a day ? i ’ d like to know if turmeric powder is just fine to consume for the benefits or do we need to consume curcumin extract powder standardized to contain 95 % curcuminoids , no body is talking about this and i think it ’ s pretty important when it comes to consuming turmeric.any body have any thoughts on this ? dennis , i have not found any research papers on turmeric vs. curcumin extract . those that sell curcumn extract make a convincing sales pitch , that ’ s for sure . however my own personal experiences with turmeric over this past year has proved to me that my body responds well to it . i receive a definite benefit from daily consumption of turmeric and have documented and tested the results to my satisfaction.yup , been consuming 3 teaspoons fresh turmeric powder with black pepper , almost daily , for about a year . i miss some days but pretty consistent . i have stopped for a week at a time to test results . it ’ s all subjective , but i find that i am very flexible , no sore muscles , no joint aches , when i ’ m on it . i run and lift weights , and at 62 if i don ’ t take turmeric daily , with my strenuous workouts , i get sore and achy . with turmeric i feel great , like back in my 30 ’ s . i ’ m also taking it for prostate cancer prevention along with many other natural clean foods ; so far so good – no tumors . all the men in my family have died from it , so i ’ m pretty extreme with my eating ; natural foods are medicine for me . thank you dr. greger for all your work . i ’ ve pulled many , many tips from your web site and worked them into my cancer beat down food protocol . blessings to you and family.dr. greger , this article is right on time for me . i am gathering information on cell replacement . different sources give different times for cell regeneration for different cells . red bloods are replaced around every three months , but are bone cells completely replaced in 3 months ?

21	testing turmeric on smokers researchers are becoming increasingly aware of “ plant-derived substances that act as chemopreventive agents . ” chemopreventatives are substances that help prevent cancer , as opposed to chemotherapy agents aimed at treating cancer . these plant-derived substances are not only inexpensive , they are also easily available and may have no or limited toxicity . since 1987 , the national cancer institute has tested more than a thousand different potential agents for chemopreventive activity , of which only a few dozen were moved to clinical trials . curcumin , present in the indian spice , turmeric , which is used in curry powder , is one such agent currently under clinical investigation for cancer chemoprevention . according to their mode of action , chemopreventive agents are classified into different subgroups : antiproliferatives , antioxidants , or carcinogen-blockers . curcumin belongs to all three , given its multiple mechanisms of action . curcumin appears to play a role helping to block every stage of cancer transformation , proliferation , and invasion , and may even help before carcinogens even get to our cells . a study back in 1987 , highlighted in my video , carcinogen blocking effects of turmeric , investigated the effects of curcumin on the mutagenicity ( dna mutating ability ) of several toxins and found that curcumin was an effective antimutagen against several environmental and standard mutagenic and cancer-causing substances . however , this was in vitro ( from the latin meaning “ in glass , ” as in a test tube or petri dish ) . what about in people ? we can ’ t just take a group of people and expose them to some nasty carcinogen so we can give half of them turmeric and see what happens . we could wait until some toxic waste spill happens or nuclear accident , but otherwise , how could researchers find people who would voluntarily expose themselves to carcinogens — unless , they smoke ! that ’ s why researchers test antimutagenic agents on smokers , who have carcinogens coursing through their veins every day . if smokers pee on some bacteria , the number of dna mutations shoot up dramatically . remember , all life is encoded by dna , whether bacteria , banana , or bunny rabbit . ( when measuring urinary mutagens , it ’ s easier to just pee on some bacteria . ) the urine of nonsmokers caused far fewer dna mutations . it makes sense : nonsmokers have fewer chemicals running through their system . if we have nonsmokers eat some turmeric for a month , nothing really happens . but what if we do the same for smokers ? in just fifteen days the mutagenic potential of their urine noticeably decreases , and it drops even more by day 30 . the turmeric the researchers used was not some concentrated curcumin supplement , but just plain turmeric you might buy at the store . they also used less than a teaspoon of turmeric a day , indicating that dietary turmeric is an effective anti-mutagen . however , in the same study the researchers found an even more effective anti-mutagen : not smoking . even after eating turmeric for a month , the dna-damaging power of smoker pee exceeded that of nonsmokers . to find out more , check out back to our roots : curry and cancer and turmeric curcumin reprogramming cancer cell death . other foods that may protect dna include kiwifruit ( kiwifruit and dna repair ) , cruciferous vegetables ( dna protection from broccoli ) , leafy vegetables ( eating green to prevent cancer ) , garlic ( cancer , interrupted : garlic & flavonoids ) , green tea ( cancer , interrupted : green tea ) , but which is better ? ( antimutagenic activity of green versus white tea ) , and plants in general ( repairing dna damage ) . smokers are common research subjects for carcinogen studies . but other groups of people following similar lifestyles are used . for example , see what happens to carcinogen levels when those eating processed meat start eating vegetarian in my video heterocyclic amines in eggs , cheese , and creatine . dr. greger , is there a comparison between the urine of non-smokers eating turmeric regularly and that of non-smokers who don ’ t consume turmeric regularly ? thanks.hi mario . yes , i think that is what this study , effect of turmeric on urinary mutagens in smokers looked at . researchers found no difference in urinary excretion of mutagens from non-smokers . concluding “ dietary turmeric is an effective anti-mutagen and it may be useful in chemoprevention . ” i meant to post this to you so you could have dr. greger look into this . it ’ s a big deal , apparently . hopkins , as you know , one of the most reputable medical institutions on earth . if not “ the ” most.the johns hopkins lupus center has recently listed garlic as a food to be avoided by persons diagnosed with lupus ( systemic lupus erythematosus , or sle ) .i saw it circulating on the internet . not sure if true , as i did not see any actual research . want to call the lupus center and ask them ? that is my best thought.of the thousand possible chemopreventive agents tested by the national cancer institute , what are the others , besides turmeric , that were effective enough to be moved to clinical trials ? it seems like there are many . one i found on grape seed extract , but this paper discusses progress in cancer chemoprevention : development of diet-derived chemopreventive agents . maybe that can help.yes , thank you very much ! off topic , but important for animal rights ! please sign this petition to tell congress to support the aware act to end the horrific animal cruelty at the usda. http : / / salsa3.salsalabs.com / o / 50865 / p / dia / action3 / common / public / ? action _ key = 16552as an ex-smoker i was very interested in turmeric . however , i ran across a study- lung tumor promotion by curcumin , ( june 2009 ) which suggest that curcumin actually promotes lung tumors in smokers and ex smokers . therefore , i have stayed away from it . has there been any recent studys which suggest different results ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2691137 / that ’ s a government site , who do you trust when government talks about gdp , gdp economic benefits when people are sick , therefore become dependent on a system of sickness till death , when you pay for it from your earnings.good find . i read the abstract and it appears it is a mouse study , so until there are human data i don ’ t think there is much concern for smokers using turmeric.the johns hopkins lupus center has recently listed garlic as a food to be avoided by persons diagnosed with lupus ( systemic lupus erythematosus , or sle ) .dr. greger , this article reminds me of an email exchange that you and i had once . in that email , i asked about the efficacy of the alcat test , which takes your blood and exposes it in vials to 150 foods and watches the reaction . those for which your white blood cells show a stronger reaction are then suggested to be ones to avoid . you didn ’ t have any particular thoughts about the test . is the acceptance of testing like this on the rise ? the recommended amount of any substance is rarely mentioned if at all in these studies.i read the help and / or cure of cancer but never emphysema . why ? what is the recommended dosage of turmeric for a 175lb smoker ? what is the recommended dosage of turmeric for a 175lb smoker ? antioxidants , cancer , carcinogens , chemotherapy , curcumin , curry powder , dna damage , india , metastases , national cancer institute , oxidative stress , smoking , spices , tobacco , turmeric - -
24	alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies in my video preventing childhood allergies , i noted a study in japan that found higher maternal intake of meat during pregnancy was significantly associated with about three times the odds of both suspected and physician-diagnosed eczema . the researchers suggest that certain components of meat may affect the fetal immune system . but what about the moms , themselves ? a plant-based diet may also help alleviate allergies in adults . see say no to drugs by saying yes to more plants and preventing allergies in adulthood . seasonal allergies have exploded in japan in the past few decades , starting with the first reported case in 1964 and now affecting millions every year . we ’ ve seen a rising prevalence of allergic diseases around the industrialized world in past decades , but perhaps nothing quite this dramatic . some have suggested that profound changes in the japanese diet may have played a role . over the latter half of the century total meat , fish , and milk intake rose hundreds of percent in japan , so researchers decided to look into dietary meat and fat intake and the prevalence of these seasonal pollen allergies . no association with overall fat , but “ higher meat intake was significantly associated with an increased prevalence . ” saturated fat wasn ’ t associated with increased prevalence either , so what other constituents in meat may be to blame ? the researchers considered the cooked meat carcinogens , the heterocyclic amines , the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and the nitrosamines . a new review , highlighted in my video , alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies , however , raised an intriguing possibility . there ’ s a class of industrial pollutants called alkylphenols , recognized as common toxic endocrine disrupting chemicals that tend to accumulate in the human body and may be associated with allergic diseases . a variety of studies have shown how they may exacerbate allergen-induced inflammation , “ suggesting that alkylphenol exposure may influence the onset , progression , and severity of allergic diseases . ” these toxic xenoestrogens can be found in human breast milk , in our body fat , in our urine , in our bloodstream , and even in the umbilical cord blood going to our babies . how did it get there ? through contaminated food . it all goes back to a famous study about the reduction of penis size and testosterone levels in alligators living in a contaminated environment . i don ’ t know what you do for a day job , but these researchers observed that a population of juvenile alligators living on one lake in florida exhibited a “ significantly smaller penis size ” and lower blood concentrations of testosterone compared to animals on some different lake . the most important difference between the two lakes was that lake stubby was fed by relatively polluted waters . they attributed the “ short penis phenomenon ” to estrogen-mimicking ( xenoestrogenic ) environmental metabolites of ddt that still pollute our earth . this seminal work introduced the concept of endocrine disruptors . environmental xenoestrogens might result in feminization of exposed male animals . and that ’ s just the shriveled tip of the iceberg . since then , endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been implicated in the dramatic rise over the last 50 years of diseases like breast cancer , prostate cancer , testicular cancer , diabetes , obesity , and fertility ( such as dropping normal sperm counts ) , genital birth defects such as penile malformations , preterm birth , neurobehavioral disorders in children linked to thyroid disruption , and earlier breast development in young girls . because genes do not change fast enough to explain these increases , environmental causes must be involved . since our greatest exposure to the environment is through our gut , it ’ s no surprise that our greatest exposure to these endocrine-disrupting chemicals is through diet . to find out which foods may contain these alkylphenol endocrine disruptors , check out my video dietary sources of alkylphenol endocrine disruptors . more on endocrine disruptors in : a different class of chemicals has been found to be associated with smaller penis size in humans . see chicken consumption and the feminization of male genitalia . “ we can kind of cut out the middlefish and move lower down the food chain in hopes of decreasing our exposure to industrial toxins ” , as you say . one more good reason , if needed , to go wpfd . thanks again , dr greger ! maybe you oversaw that inadvertedly or left it out on purpose , but there is no proof for your statement that the prevalence of allergies has exploded in japan since 1964 . the number of diagnosed cases has started to rise since 1964 , which is mainly due to better diagnosis and awareness int he population . allergies have existed for longer than 1964 so any conclusion based on your statement is invalid , because no reliable data exist.christian jo , what is unreliable about the study dr. greger sited , showing that allergies increased 2.6 times from 1980 to 2000 ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15746556yes this study ’ s data shouldn ’ t be labeled invalid . the study does show that there is an increase in allergies so i think that ’ s a fact . i would think that the diagnosis and awareness during that 2 decade time period remained constant from constant sampling techniques . so the increase in diagnosis and awareness shouldn ’ t play a major role . i ’ m not really experienced in this but this is what i think.the only fact is that the number of diagnosed cases of allergies rose. all the rest is speculation … .you can still not draw a strict conclusion based on these data because you dont have a proper control-group . absolute numbers of people with allergies could have dropped in the time between 1980 and 2000 whilst the diagnosed cases rise due to the abovementioned reasons.hi christian you bring up important points regarding diagnostic methods post 1964 . i don ’ t think any “ strict conclusion ” was drawn though ? dr. greger is simply reporting the evidence that is available . i agree it would be nice to see more data ! please share anything you find to help us learn more about allergies and pollutants . thanks ! lake stubby ! i love your humor.the japanese sure are having their lifespans reduced by our way of life . perhaps they are an island nation with the exact surface area to volume ratio for long life . perhaps they refuse to eat the foods of their ancestors as a way of letting go . perhaps they have yet to achieve what they say they have . perhaps they are a society of immigrants like our own nation awaiting a trip to america.thanks as always for your wonderful work dr. greger , i send all my clients to your wonderful website. adolescence , alkylphenols , allergies , animal fat , animal products , animal studies , birth defects , body fat , breast cancer , breast development , breast health , breast milk , cancer , carcinogens , children , cognition , dairy , ddt , diabetes , eczema , endocrine disruptors , fat , fertility , fish , heterocyclic amines , immune function , industrial toxins , infants , infertility , inflammation , japan , meat , men 's health , mental health , milk , nitrosamines , obesity , penis health , penis size , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , prediabetes , pregnancy , premature puberty , prostate cancer , prostate health , puberty , saturated fat , sexual dysfunction , sexual health , sperm counts , testicular cancer , testicular health , testosterone , thyroid disease , thyroid health , women 's health , xenoestrogens - -
25	slowing cognitive decline with berries a plant-based diet is thought to have played a significant role in human evolution and the consumption of whole plant foods and even just extracts have repeatedly been associated with a decreased risk of aging related diseases . and by healthy aging i ’ m not talking preventing wrinkles , what about protecting our brain ? “ two of the most dreaded consequences of dementia with aging are problems moving around and difficulty remembering things . dementia robs older adults of their independence , control , and identity . ” fruits and vegetables help reduce the risk of other chronic diseases , so might they work for brain diseases as well ? there has been a proliferation of recent interest in plant polyphenols as agents in the treatment of dementia . there are 4,000 different kinds of polyphenols found ubiquitously in foods of plant origin , but berries are packed with them , possessing powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . there ’ s a subset of polyphenols called anthocyanidins , which are found in blue and purple pigmented fruits and berries . these polyphenols are uniquely and specifically capable of “ both crossing the blood – brain barrier and localizing in brain regions involved in learning and memory . ” and that ’ s precisely where we need them . the brain takes up less than 2 % of body weight but may burn up to 50 % of the body ’ s fuel , creating a potential firestorm of free radicals . maybe these brain-seeking phytonutrients in berries could fight oxidation and inflammation , and even increase blood flow ? this raised a thought-provoking idea . maybe a “ nutritional intervention with blueberries may be effective in forestalling or even reversing the neurological changes associated with aging ? ” it would be a decade before the first human trial was conducted , but it worked ! “ blueberry supplementation improves memory in older adults , ” suggesting that “ consistent supplementation with blueberries may offer an approach to forestall or mitigate brain degeneration with age . ” what other blue or purple foods can we try ? concord grape juice was also tested and had a similar benefit , suggesting that supplementation with purple grape juice may enhance cognitive function for older adults with early memory decline . why use juice and not whole concord grapes ? because then you couldn ’ t design a placebo that looked and tasted exactly the same to rule out the very real and powerful placebo effect . and also because the study was funded by the welch ’ s grape juice company . this effect was confirmed in a follow-up study , showing for the first time an increase in neural activation in parts of the brain associated with memory using functional mri scans . but this brain scan study was tiny : just four people in each group . and same problem in the blueberry study : it had only nine people in it . why haven ’ t large population-based studies been done ? because we haven ’ t had good databases on where these phytonutrients are found . we know how much vitamin c is in a blueberry , but not how much anthocyanidin — until now . the harvard nurses ’ health study , highlighted in my video , how to slow brain aging by two years , followed the cognitive function of more than 16,000 women for years , and found that “ long-term consumption of berries was related to significantly slower rates of cognitive decline , even after careful consideration of confounding socioeconomic status ” ( that is , even after taking into account the fact that rich people eat more berries ) . the harvard nurses ’ health study was the first population-based evidence that greater intakes of blueberries and strawberries were highly associated with slower rates of cognitive decline , and not just by a little bit . “ the magnitude of associations were equivalent to the cognitive differences that one might observe in women up to two and a half years apart in age . ” in other words , women with higher intake of berries appeared to have delayed cognitive aging by as much as two and a half years . why shouldn ’ t we just take some anthocyanidin supplement ? because there hasn ’ t been a single study that found any kind of cognitive benefit by just giving single phytonutrients . in fact , the opposite is true . “ whole blueberries appear to be more effective than individual components , showing that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts . ” these findings have potentially substantial public health implications , as increasing berry intake represents a fairly simple dietary modification to test in older adults for maintaining our brain function . what other ways could we improve our memory and cognitive function ? what other near-miraculous properties of berries are there ? i add them to my morning smoothie : a better breakfast . is there anything better than a bowl of berries with some chai spices ? https : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2015 / 01 / 25 / anti-cancer-strategies-3-better-ways-of-eating-berries / read this while eating a bowl of oatmeal full of berries ! those 2.5 years are mine ! oh wait , i ’ m not female . are there any studies showing cognitive benefits for male berry munchers ? good point . for men , i would expect similar results . this study discusses how dash and mediterranean diets help reduce cognitive decline in elderly men . in particular , nuts , legumes , and whole grains were found to be significatly protective . the authors conclude these foods “ may be core neuroprotective foods common to various healthy plant-centered diets around the globe . ” lastly , this study found some associations with certain fruits and vegetables and less cognitive decline . i wonder if berries were responsible ? if you are looking for more information on men , check out the 12 videos at the end of this blog post , as so many studies are covered by dr. greger . hope that helps ! what about indian gooseberries ? or the amalaki powder derived from them ? i take the powder nearly every day in a green smoothie – thanks to dr. gregor ’ s advice.indian gooseberries ( alma ) may help with diabetes . amla has been extensively studies and found protective for many disorders , perhaps due to it ’ s high antioxidant capacity ? when i searched about cognitive decline only animal studies were available , which doesn ’ t tell us anything of value for how it works in humans . however , one review mentioned the phytochemicals in alma like quercetin , gallic acid , corilagin and ellagic acid , therefore some logic that this stuff could help reduce cognitive decline may be apparently , but of course we need a human trial to know for sure.blueberries and oatmeal , the true breakfast of champions ! unfortunately , organic berries are no longer in my budget , which kinda concerns me since blueberries are listed as one of the “ dirty dozen . ” i have no choice but assume the benefits outway the risks , as these studies do not specify “ organic ” , so we can assume they ’ re not . once again , why does organic have to be so darn expensive … a rhetorical question of course , my apologies.no apologies , i agree ! perhaps we all need to forage for berries , collect gallons , and freeze them so we have peak-ripenened berries all the time ! ok , so in a perfect world that may be the case … .i agree , the benefit of eating conventional berries outweigh the risks of not consuming them . luckily , dr. greger dedicated a huge section of his new dvd to this important question is buying organic worth it ? i highly recommend seeing what his new review suggests ! are wild blueberries grown without pesticides , etc . ? hmmm i am not sure ? anybody have the answer to that ? i think if they don ’ t say “ organic ” unfortunately pesticides may still exists , even on a label that says “ wild ” . please correct me if i am wrong . i think the only “ wild ” berries with no pesticides would come from my fantasized idea of walking in a dense forest with a plethora of wild berry bushes : - ) i ’ m awaiting an answer from the wild blueberry association . do you check your fb page for messages ? you are right , joseph . unless labeled “ organic ” , wild blueberries are definitely sprayed with both herbicides and pesticides.i don ’ t believe all wild blueberries are necessarily organic but – i ’ ve worked with the wild blueberry folks and they indicate that the wild blueberries are actually higher in antioxidants than cultivated berries . # goodtoknow ! i think they taste better too ! http : / / www.superberries.com / assets / images / pdfs / orac _ r2fruit-vegetables2010.pdfblack raspberry 19220 ; chokeberry 16062 ; elderberry 14697 ; wild blueberry 9621 ; blackberry 5905 ; blueberry 4669 ; sweet cherries 3747 ; gooseberry 3332 ; goji 3290.of course they do . this is a matter of volume . smaller berries means by volume ( per cup ) , you ’ re eating more . more berries , more antioxidants . oh and you ’ re right , the wild variety are generally sweeter . i love ‘ em. strawberries are a close second though.http : / / www.superfoodsrx.com / nutrition / nutritional-research / wild-vs-cultivated-blueberries-56.html “ wild ” refers to a slightly different type of berry.http : / / www.superfoodsrx.com / nutrition / nutritional-research / wild-vs-cultivated-blueberries-56.htmlunfortunately not.some could be . wild blueberries are not cultivated , and not easy to grow . they are smaller , and taste better too . just last year a big national brand sold frozen wild blueberries which stated right on the label , “ grown without pesticides ” , not organic , but that was good enough for me . they ’ re gone now . btw , organic does not mean without pesticides , it means without synthetic pesticides . also , i believe that some frozen fruits & veggies “ may ” have less chemicals ( at least on the surface ) because they ’ re rinsed before freezing , but you can research that for yourself.thanks for the reply , but the dvds aren ’ t specific as to their content.any clue on how many berries you need to eat to make a difference ? i think most studies show like a half-cup to a cup of berries . so not much at all . feel free to browse the “ sources cited ” section of this video to see the exact doses . if you can ’ t find it holler and i ’ ll look . thanks , david.i don ’ t see a “ sources cited ” section . do you mean the hyperlinked articles ? i think the amount is critical and a definitive answer with sources would be great.ok no problem . i know there are many buttons on the site . i was referring to the video “ how to slow brain aging by two years ” that i hyperlinked in my comment above . you are right that this blog post only has hyperlinks and they do link to the studies themselves , but if you get to the video , under the title there are buttons that are super helpful like “ view transcripts ” and “ sources cited ” which show all of the research papers used to create the video.the amount of berries consumed differ from each study . for example , the concord grape study gave about 15ounces of grape juice daily , but those with more body weight drank a bit more . in the harvard nurses ’ health study women eating more more than 1 serving of blueberries per week and more than 2 servings of strawberries ( a half cup is a serving ) per week had better results . so i ’ d say a half-cup to a cup of berries per day is all you ’ d need to see improvements , which is pretty constant with other studies the dr. greger covers in the video how much fruit is too much ? i also think variety is key , as berries are high in anthocyanidins other foods like oranges and tea have far more flavones and flavonols.here is an exerpt from life extension magazine which did a cover story on blueberries in the april 2015 issue : “ why not just eat the berries and get the anthocyanins from your diet ? for one thing , it would be prohibitively expensive , since whole-berry studies typically require 350 grams ( about 3 / 4 of a pound ) of berries to achieve effects … eating too many whole blueberries can offset the incredible benefits conferred by the natural polyphenols they contain . the cost of blueberry extract is also quite low in comparison to the whole fruit . ” they go on to state , “ blueberry extract ( including stems ) is even more potent the the whole berry or juice , providing greater metabolic support throughout the entire body and without the excess sugar of the raw fruit … .wild blueberries possess up to 10 times the nutritional capacity of cultivated berries . ” full article for those interested : http : / / www.lifeextension.com / magazine / 2015 / 4 / blueberries-boost-longevity-beyond-calorie-restriction / page-01i take one supplement from lef . they have a good reputation for integrity , safety , and seem to reference a lot of credible research . but you have to remember , they ’ re in the business of selling supplements . imho : unless i have very good specific reason to take a concentrated processed food supplement , i ’ d rather just eat the food . so far , the only supplement i know of that dr. greger recommends for strict vegans ( of which i am not ) , is b12 . if you don ’ t eat blueberries , start . if you do , then do you “ need ” added blueberry extract in a pill ? to each his own on that one . i ’ m a big fan of “ jerf ” : just eat real food.just an hour ago i came upon some unopened bags of aronia berries ( black chokeberries ) stored in the back of the freezer , and forgotten — “ until now ” ( lol ) . a quick nutrition profile search mentions their huge anthocyanidin content , the highest of any berry in fact . many other antioxidants as well.then tasting them reminded me why they got tossed : they taste like cardboard ! but now mixing them with wild blueberries and pomegranate juice and lightly sprinkling with stevia powder makes all the sweet difference.dr. greger clearly prefers whole foods or perhaps juices in the case of concord grapes , to supplements containing single phytonutrients . but what about blueberry or pomegranate concentrate pills i ’ ve seen for sale on the internet and heath magazines ? or what about elderberry syrup or grapeseed or hawthorn extract capsules etc . ? is there any benefit from taking them or are they a waste of money ? i wouldn ’ t go for the pills , but elderberry and hawthorn if used in the right circumstances i believe would have value.are dried fruits like raisins and dried wild blueberries as nutritious in polyphenols and anthocyanidins as fresh whole grapes or blueberries ? ( dried or baked kale chips – as nutritious as non-dried kale ? ) thanksyes , i think dried fruit has it ’ s place. it still has many of the polyphenol properties . when fresh is not available i see no concern with dried or frozen fruit and however you ’ re going to eat more kale is fine with me : - ) question for the dietitian : blueberries are so tasty that they are easy to add , but i read recently that beet juice had been shown in a study to lower blood pressure significantly . my question is whether whole beets steamed are as effective as beet juice ? also , should i limit the amount of beets i eat because of the sugar in them ? i have been eating 3 / 4 cup of steamed beets a day to lower blood pressure . see article : hypertension . 2015 feb ; 65 ( 2 ) : 320-7. doi : 10.1161 / hypertensionaha.114.04675. epub 2014 nov 24.dietary nitrate provides sustained blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients : a randomized , phase 2 , double-blind , placebo-controlled study.kapil v1 , khambata rs1 , robertson a1 , caulfield mj1 , ahluwalia a2.i think steamed beets are delicious and beneficial . often studies are conducted for ease so they may have used beet juice because participants handle better than eating whole steamed beets ( i am not certain if this is the case here ) . i suggest eating beets and blueberries ! rule of thumb – foods in their whole state are preferred . keep up the healthful eating ! thank you.sent from my ipadis there any study which shows anthocyanidins in plumbs ? my word recall has significantly improved in recent weeks ( 62 , female ) . noticeable to spouse . i ’ ve made a number of improvements in diet this year , but improvement in word recall seems to be correlated with inclusion of 1 / 2 c or so of frozen blueberries / strawberries / cherries in daily smoothie . before , i would need a word like “ anthrax ” , say , and would have difficulty pulling it immediately from the “ a ” shelf , rather than a similar word . ( my brain seems to store words alphabetically ? : - ) small sample size ( 1 ! ) , many confounding factors , but reason enough for me to continue with the berries ! you wrote , “ “ long-term consumption of berries was related to significantly slower rates of cognitive decline . . . ” i wish popular writers would state whether they mean “ statistically significant ” or “ wow , that was really significant ! ” i ’ m a scientist and am familiar with the difference . but a statistically significant difference might be trivial , just that there was 95 % chance that the observed difference was not by chance . using the same word for quite different meanings , either of which might be the one meant , leads everyone including scientists to be confused.thanks for the suggestion . note that the link to the harvard nurse ’ s health study is provided and anyone can dig into the papers themselves for more clarification. aging , anthocyanins , antioxidants , berries , blueberries , brain disease , brain health , chronic diseases , cognition , concord grapes , dementia , evolution , fruit , fruit juice , grape juice , grapes , harvard nurses ' health study , inflammation , memory , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , placebo effect , plant-based diets , polyphenols , strawberries , supplements , vegetables , vitamin c , wrinkles - -
26	what is ‘ meat glue ’ ? the so-called “ meat glue enzyme ” transglutaminase is used by the meat industry to add value to meat by gluing together smaller scraps into a larger chunk . and it ’ s not just used to make fake steak — the american meat institute estimates that it ’ s used in about “ eight million pounds of meat every year in the united states . ” transglutaminase can be used to cross-link pieces of any type of meat , fish , or meat product , and hence can be used to produce large chunks of virtually intact looking meat or fish out of small meat or fish cuttings . when researchers actually tested for transglutaminase in 20 samples of meat from the supermarket , they found meat glue in only two of the samples — in a sample of salmon and a sample of turkey ( see is meat glue safe ? ) where does meat glue come from ? for decades , the sole commercial source of transglutaminase was from the livers of guinea pigs . now it can be sourced much cheaper . however , the future of meat glue remains uncertain because of “ communication difficulties . ” one of the reasons the industry uses meat glue enzymes is because , “ restructured meat can be made from underutilized portions of the carcasses . ” for example , you can get away with adding up to 5 % tendons to beef , and some people can ’ t tell the difference . this has raised food safety concerns . there is a “ risk that otherwise discarded leftovers of questionable microbial quality could find their way into the reconstituted meat . ” one can actually take a microscope and see introduced e. coli o157 : h7 along the glue lines where meat pieces were enzymatically attached , which shows that the restructuring process can translocate fecal matter surface contamination into the interior of the meat . furthermore , people who have problems with gluten may develop problems when ingesting meat treated with the meat glue enzyme , since it functions as an auto-antigen capable of inducing an autoimmune reaction . ( many gluten reactions may not actually be to gluten , though . see my video is gluten sensitivity real ? and most need not worry about gluten sensitivity . see my video is gluten bad for you ? ) . some meat additives , however , may actually improve food safety . see meat additives to diminish toxicity , viral meat spray and maggot meat spray . more on e. coli o157 : h7 in my video , meat may exceed daily allowance of irony . for those interested in the politics of this “ jack-in-the-box ” strain , see my blogs e. coli o145 ban opposed by meat industry and supreme court case : meat industry sues to keep downed animals in food supply . from a population perspective , the e. coli in chicken is more of a concern . see my video avoiding chicken to avoid bladder infections . do we know what brands use this meat glue ? would love some advice as to how to stay away from this ! so appaulinghow about avoiding animal protein , altogether ? i ’ ll look into this , but to my knowledge it ’ s so poorly inspected and regulated that it would be very hard to know what companies use it . i ’ ll post any new info i find here . thanks , michellesort of related to this , how susceptible am i too catching viruses , bacteria , diseases , illnesses , and such as a result of working as the checkout scanner / cashier at the grocery store thus having to handle raw chicken packages , red meat packages , pork , turkey , egg cartons , etc . ? if i am having to handle these “ wrapped ” yet often dripping in juice-packages dozens of times a day , should this be a huge concern of mine , or will my body build up resistance to the pathogens ? i am hoping this is not the disease route of some diseases we chalk up as being caused from other things . thanks . i am very concerned at my age to being exposed to these things , but i also do not want to over react . i ’ d rather follow what the science says.heather does your work allow you to wear gloves ? dr. gregor has some great videos on contamination . click on health topics above.yes , but the gloves are cumbersome , thus not user friendly . i ’ m just wondering how big of an issue and concern this should be for regular grocery store workers working the checkout counter . i have watched all the videos on this on this website , but i do not seem to get an answer from the videos or opinion from dr. g if this is a legitimate concern for us checkout counter workers.there are latex and non latex gloves fit for a king , surgeon , deli workers , food handlers and you name it . at a checkout counter i would be more worried what the customer thought . don ’ t wear a mask too.hi heather . legitimate concerns you address . handling those products can put you at greater risk . best to keep as sanitary as possible . gloves are an option as others have mentioned . have you seen this post about chicken ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 03 / 17 / meat-industry-wins-right-to-sell-tainted-meat / my best advice is wear gloves and sanitize the checkout conveyor belt often.hi heather , when i read your post , i was thinking of this video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / meat-borne-infection-risk-from-shopping-carts / yes , informative video . but from what i read elsewhere , this is not as big of an issue for adults – our immune systems are developed , mature . i hope doctor g. can offer some insight on this issue today on this post . please , dr. g ? … … from a concerned vegan grocery store employee.turkey brest by butterball is glued together with something .. and doesn ’ t seem fit … related to this is the recent finding by nih that emulsifiers , like polysorbate-80 , added to many processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life actually promote colitis and metabolic syndrome in mice by altering their gut microbes and by breaking down the protective mucus layer lining the colon and exposing it to bacteria. http : / / www.nih.gov / researchmatters / march2015 / 03162015additives.htmthe fact that an enzyme is extracted from the livers of guinea pigs is not only greatly disturbing but very upsetting that most meat products will not have this information on the product itself . can this meat glue be used on any meat ? looks like it , as they found it in supermarket salmon and turkey , but i do not know all of the restrictions . it is misleading to say the least.go organic or go vegan ! this probably increases the mass of the chicken too . the meat industry is a very secretive industry … meat glue … ugh , what a resulsive sick idea.is this something we will find in our cuts of meat from the butcher or meat section of the supermarket , or more likely something that would be found in processed food such as “ turkey loaf ” and things such as that ?

27	is liquid smoke safe ? we know smoke inhalation isn ’ t good for us , but what about smoke ingestion ? decades ago , smoke flavorings were tested to see if they caused dna mutations in bacteria — the tests came up negative . even as more and more smoke flavoring was added , the dna mutation rate remained about the same . but the fact that something is not mutagenic in bacteria may have little predictive value for its effect on human cells . a group at mit tested a hickory smoke flavoring they bought at the store against two types of human white blood cells . unlike the bacteria , the mutation rate shot up as more and more liquid smoke was added . but , “ there is no evidence that mutagenic activity in a particular human cell line is more closely related to human health risk than is mutagenic activity in bacteria . ” in other words : just because liquid smoke causes dna mutations to human cells in a petri dish , doesn ’ t mean that it does the same thing within the human body . a good approach may be to just analyze liquid smoke for known carcinogens , chemicals that we know cause cancer . damaging dna is just one of many ways chemicals can be toxic to cells . a decade later researchers tested to see what effect liquid smoke had on overall cell viability . if you drip water on cells , nothing happens , they keep powering away at around 100 % survival , but drip on more and more wood fire smoke , and you start killing some of the cells off . cigarette smoke is more toxic , but three out of four of the brands of liquid smoke they bought at the supermarket killed off even more cells , leading them to conclude that the cytotoxic potential of some commercial smoke flavorings is greater than that of liquid cigarette smoke , a finding they no doubt celebrated given that the researchers were paid employees of the r. j. reynolds tobacco co . unfortunately they didn ’ t name names of the offending brands . that ’ s one of the reasons i was so excited about a new study , where they tested — and named – 15 different brands of liquid smoke . this maximum “ response ” they were measuring was p53 activation . p53 is a protein we make that binds to our dna , you can see this illustrated in my video , is liquid smoke flavoring carcinogenic ? . it activates our dna repair enzymes . so a big p53 response may be indicative of a lot of dna damage , and a few of the liquid smoke flavorings activated p53 almost as much as a chemotherapy drug like etoposide , whose whole purpose is to break dna strands . other flavorings didn ’ t seem as bad , though there was a hickory smoke powder that ranked pretty high , as did the fish sauce , though smoked paprika didn ’ t register at all . the p53-activating property in liquid smoke was eliminated by standard baking conditions ( 350 ° f for 1h ) , so if you ’ re baking something with liquid smoke for long enough , it should eliminate this effect , though just boiling — even for an hour , or slow cooking doesn ’ t appear to work . they conclude “ if the dna-damaging activities of liquid smoke were thought to be deleterious , it might be possible to replace liquid smoke with other safer , smoky substances . ” why do they say if thought to be deleterious ? that ’ s because they ’ re not really measuring dna damage , they ’ re measuring p53 activation , and that ’ s not necessarily a bad thing . p53 is considered “ guardian of our genome , ” guardian of our dna . it ’ s considered a tumor suppressor gene , so if something boosts its activity is that good or bad ? it ’ s like the broccoli story . cruciferous vegetables dramatically boost our liver ’ s detoxifying enzymes . is this because our body sees broccoli as toxic and is trying to get rid of it quicker ? either way , the end result is good , lower cancer risk . it ’ s a biological phenomenon known as hormesis – that which doesn ’ t kill us may make us stronger . like exercise is a stress on the body , but in the right amount can make us healthier in the long run . so , for example , teas and coffees caused p53 activation as well , but their consumption is associated with lower cancer risk . so it ’ s hard to know what to make of this p53 data . due to the limitations of the available tests it ’ s hard to calculate the genotoxic potential of liquid smoke , or any other food for that matter . a better approach may be to just analyze liquid smoke for known carcinogens , chemicals that we know cause cancer . this was first attempted back in 1971 . one of the seven liquid smoke flavors researchers tested contained one polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known to be cancer-causing , but there ’ s a bunch of similar carcinogens researchers didn ’ t test for . a later study , however , tested across the board , looking specifically at five different carcinogens in retail liquid smoke seasonings . the recommended daily upper safety limit for these carcinogens is 47 . hickory smoke flavoring has only 0.8 per teaspoon , so we ’ d have to drink three bottles a day to bump up against the limit . and mesquite liquid smoke has only 1.1 . it turns out that most of the carcinogens in smoke are fat soluble , so when we make a water-based solution , like liquid smoke , we capture the smoke flavor compounds without capturing most of the smoke cancer compounds . the only time we need to really worry is when eating smoked foods — foods directly exposed to actual smoke . for example , smoked ham has 21.3 per serving , and smoked turkey breast has 26.7 per serving . one sandwich and we may be halfway to the limit , and one serving of barbequed chicken takes us over the top . eating less than a single drumstick and we nearly double our daily allotment of these carcinogens . nothing , however , is as bad as fish . smoked herring ? 140 per serving . and smoked salmon ? one bagel with lox could take us ten times over the limit . i ’ ve touched on those cooked meat carcinogens before . in estrogenic cooked meat carcinogens i explored the role of these cooked meat chemicals in tumor growth . phip : the three strikes breast carcinogen explored their role in cancer invasion . reducing cancer risk in meateaters offered some mediation strategies . heterocyclic amines in eggs , cheese , and creatine ?

: - ( hi ravi k. it wouldn ’ t appear so seems how liquid smoke has only 0.8 per teaspoon of carcinogens and the upper safety limit is 47.the bacon on the other hand … one has to have fun with food while being vegan ; - ) . wonder where liquid aminos fall on this scale ? i had never heard of coconut bacon . i assumed it was some sort of preparation method for bacon.anyway , the only thing i found on braggs is this : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-msg-bad-for-you / so , if grilled meats carry carcinogens , do grilled vegetables pick them up too ? or does grilled food only absorb the carcinogens when it has a high fat content ? so meat , or perhaps vegetables coated in oil would , but vegetables without oil wouldn ’ t ? hi jess . meat contains creatine and sugar , which combined form heterocyclic amines – potentially mutagenic / carcinogenic compounds . since veggies and plants lack creatine they do not form these dangerous compounds . veggies on the grill can pick up polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , however , you are thinking right as more pahs stem from fat dripping onto the grill , so perhaps less fat would yield less pahs if grilling vegetables . one thing is for certain the smoked meats appear the most dangerous.we indians are fond of smoked brinjal bharta ( the inner of roasted brinjal ) . what is your opinion regarding health ? hi dr. agarwal . i couldn ’ t find anything on that product . i think if large doses of veggies are eaten with spices like liquid smoke or others the benefit of eating the whole foods outweigh any potential negative associations with the spices . in general , herbs and spices are bursting with antioxidants ! if i find out more about this spice i ’ ll post it . thanks ! hi dr. greger and joe , i have a question that has been bothering me . i was wondering about your opinions on mikoyo ’ s creamery ’ s smoked farmhouse cheese . it ’ s a fermented nut cheese made from cashews , miso and nutritional yeast and unlike many other vegan products that use liquid smoke , it is actually smoked . since it is high in fat , do you think it would contain carcinogens like bacon ?

28	does antioxidant intake matter for stroke and heart disease ? in my video food antioxidants and cancer , i talked about how antioxidants from whole plants are associated with lower cancer risk . it turns out that total antioxidant capacity of diet may also be protective against stroke , the world ’ s leading cause of death after heart disease . this is in contradiction to all the antioxidant supplement studies that failed to show benefit . this may be because the food antioxidant studies took into account thousands of different compounds , in doses obtained from a usual diet , rather than individual nutrients at unnaturally high levels . the buildup of oxidized fat is considered the hallmark of fatty streak formation , the earliest manifestation of atherosclerotic plaques . the oxidation of fat can happen outside the body , every time we cook it , but oxidized fats are not only formed in foods , but may also be generated during digestion , especially in stomach acid . our stomach may be like a “ bioreactor for the oxidation of high-fat , cholesterol-rich foods . muscle foods contain large amounts of endogenous catalysts which accelerate fat oxidation . ” as poultry sits in our stomach , the oxidation may build up minute by minute . turn out chickens are bled of only about half their blood , and the remaining residual can be a powerful promoter of fat oxidation , so there are those in the industry advocating an additional decapitation step , but if oxidation is the problem , antioxidants can be part of the solution . we know antioxidant pills don ’ t work . while extensive experimental data “ have revealed a central role for oxidative stress in the stiffening of our arteries and suggested a potential role for ‘ antioxidant ’ treatment in cardiovascular disease , experimental data has not translated into clinical benefit . most antioxidant vitamin trials have failed to reduce heart disease and death and may in fact even be detrimental . as a result , some have even questioned the supposedly central role of oxidative stress in the disease process . ” the fact that pills didn ’ t work was described as a critical blow to the whole free radical theory of aging . but high-dose single-antioxidant supplements are not a good substitute for the very complex antioxidant network of thousands of compounds in foods , present at concentrations far below those used in those pill trials . no one had ever looked at the overall effect of the complex antioxidant network in our diet in relation to our leading killer , coronary heart disease … until now . a large prospective population-based cohort study , highlighted in my video food antioxidants , stroke , and heart disease , measured total antioxidant capacity of people ’ s diets : “ the total antioxidant capacity measures , in one single value , the free-radical-reducing capacity of all antioxidants present in foods and all the synergistic effects . ” they observed that “ higher total antioxidant capacity of diet was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of incident heart attack in a dose-response manner , ” meaning , potentially , the more high antioxidant plant foods in one ’ s diet , the better . which foods have the highest antioxidant content ? see : it ’ s the heme iron in chicken blood that may be contributing to fat oxidation in the stomach . that ’ s one of the targets of the meat additives to diminish toxicity . more on reducing stroke risk can be found in my videos preventing strokes with diet and whole grains may work as well as drugs . i have more than 150 videos on heart disease . heart disease starts in childhood and one in a thousand ending the heart disease epidemic are among two of the most recent. are frozen indian gooseberries as good as dried ? my local indian market only has frozen.hi sue . i am not sure what is better . dr. greger does have some information on indian gooseberries and the answer may be found here . hope that helps . note there are even more videos on amla ( indian gooseberries ) within that link.best , josephberry researcher dr. mary ann lila says that frozen can even be better than fresh under certain circumstances . read more here : http : / / zesterdaily.com / cooking / tips-picking-unseasonal-berries / or it could also be the anti inflammmatory of veg / fruitsgood point ! it could be , but i would think the antioxidants add to that anti-inflammatory effect.let us keep eating our fruits and veggies , legumes and nuts and seeds and pack up on the antioxidants ! ! ! ! ! thanks for all your extensive work ! best wishes from karin with family .. “ the buildup of oxidized fat is considered the hallmark of fatty streak formation , the earliest manifestation of atherosclerotic plaques . ” so where does the oxidized fat risk come from in a wfpb low processed food diet ? would like to see more information geared towards the wfpb diet rather than mostly about meat eaters.good question , jm . i suppose very little oxidative stress would occur from a whole-foods plant-based diet . oxidative damage as you mentioned may be more likely from processed foods , especially like french fries and chips . the diet would be very high in antioxidants and fiber – a good combo for reducing fatty streaks . there are many videos and blogs here that discuss avoiding this process . how to prevent heart disease , and eliminating 90 % of heart disease risk . let me know if these help ? best , josephi recall seeing research that a deficiency of b-12 can lead to deposits in arteries even in vegans.here is a link to a discussion of how best to test for b-12 problems and how best to detect issues . i especially think that elevated homocysteine is important , as it has been implicated in so many chronic challenges to bodily health. http : / / www.veganhealth.org / articles / everyveganthe link was very informative , especially what to look for in your annual blood test for b12 . the difficulty in getting fortified cereal is that most ready-made ones are high in sugar content . i am hoping that b12 supplement , nori , wakame and other seaweeds are going to be adequate.no , do not rely on these . they are not adequate . i use a xylitol chewing gum that is fortified and that also makes an environment in the mouth that does not support acid-etching bacteria . my dentist recommended this , and has her kids use it . nutritional yeast may have enough b-12 for some individuals , and my cat begs for it . he is a big old guy , maybe 20 pounds , and he eats as much as a human probably would , every day , so he is an interesting science experiment , but he also gets meat . there are concerns about using a ton of it in humans . our peristalsis is slower . going too low in b-12 is life-threatening , and it happens even to meat-eaters because assimilation is tricky . where i live , in portland , you can easily find docs who will test properly and give you shots if you are low . this is not something to mess around with , as you can get nerve and artery damage . if you have any other identifiable health issues , you need to stay on top on this , especially if you use conventional medicine that does not think about it or ask you about it.no mention of turmeric ? or ginger.hi ron . in other videos , yes . try any of these turmeric and ginger . thanks for mentioning them.best , josephfrom the text ” this may be because the food antioxidant studies took into account thousands of different compounds , in doses obtained from a usual diet , rather than individual nutrients at unnaturally high levels . ” this appears contradictory to : “ but high-dose single-antioxidant supplements are not a good substitute for the very complex antioxidant network of thousands of compounds in foods , present at concentrations far below those used in those pill trials . ” i believe the first quote is a mistatment aging , animal fat , animal products , antioxidants , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , cholesterol , factory farming practices , farm animals , fat , heart disease , heart health , ldl cholesterol , mortality , multivitamins , nutrient synergy , oxidative stress , plant-based diets , poultry , stomach health , stroke , supplements , turkey - -
29	does antioxidant intake matter for cancer ? the usda removed their online antioxidant database of foods , “ concerned that orac values were routinely misused by food and dietary supplement manufacturing companies to promote their products . ” indeed , supplement manufacturers got into my-orac-is-bigger-than-your-orac contests , comparing their pills to the antioxidant superfood du jour , like blueberries . we know there are lots of bioactive compounds in whole plant foods that may help prevent and ameliorate chronic disease in ways that have nothing to do with their antioxidant power , so i understand the usda ’ s decision . so should we just eat lots of whole healthy plant foods and not worry about which one necessarily has more antioxidants than the other , or does one ’ s dietary antioxidant intake matter ? we have some new data to help answer that question . researchers recently analyzed total dietary antioxidant capacity and the risk of stomach cancer , the world ’ s second leading cancer killer . a half million people were studied , and dietary antioxidant capacity intake from different sources of plant foods was indeed associated with a reduction in risk . note that they say dietary intake ; they ’ re not talking about supplements . not only do antioxidant pills not seem to help , they seem to increase overall mortality — that ’ s like paying to live a shorter life . just giving high doses of isolated vitamins may cause disturbances in our body ’ s own natural antioxidant network . there are hundreds of different antioxidants in plant foods . they don ’ t act in isolation ; they work synergistically . mother nature cannot be trapped in a bottle . similar results were reported with non-hodgkin ’ s lymphoma : the more orac units we eat per day , the lower our cancer risk drops ( though antioxidants or not , green leafy vegetables were particularly protective . going from eating one serving of green leafy vegetables per week to a serving a day may cut our odds of lymphoma in half ) . should we be worried about antioxidant intake during cancer treatment , since most chemo drugs work by creating free radicals ? according to some of the latest reviews , highlighted in my video food antioxidants and cancer , there is no evidence of antioxidant interference with chemotherapy , and antioxidants may actually improve treatment and patient survival . but should we take a multivitamin ? see should we take a multivitamin ? what about fish oil supplements ? is fish oil just snake oil ? i recently covered how and why we should strive to eat antioxidants with every meal in an important three-part series : preferentially getting one ’ s nutrients from produce not pills is a common theme in the nutrition literature . see , for example : antioxidants may also slow aging ( see mitochondrial theory of aging ) , reduce inflammation ( see anti-inflammatory antioxidants ) , improve digestion ( see bulking up on antioxidants ) , and help prevent copd ( see preventing copd with diet ) . so where are antioxidants found ? see my series that starts with antioxidant content of 3139 foods and antioxidant power of plant foods versus animal foods . what about the role of antioxidants in other leading causes of death ? that ’ s the subject of my video , food antioxidants , stroke , and heart disease . in the video , “ antioxidant content of 3139 foods ” the link to the references doesn ’ t work , but then i found that the usda has published a more recent paper on the antioxidant content of foods . i ’ m having fun looking over this data . first surprise was that figs have more antioxidant power than goji berries. http : / / www.orac-info-portal.de / download / orac _ r2.pdfhi julie . thanks for the heads up we ’ ll update that reference and include the one you found from 2010 , href = ” http : / / www.orac-info-portal.de / download / orac _ r2.pdf ” target = ” _ blank ” > usda report.very interesting . thanks for the link . black raspberry 19220 ; chokeberry 16062 ; elderberry 14697 ; wild blueberry 9621 ; blackberry 5905 ; blueberry 4669 ; sweet cherries 3747 ; gooseberry 3332 ; goji 3290.with cancer ( stage 3c ovarian – 7 years ) , the role of orac in cancer inhibition is one layer of an “ idea ” . it appears mitochondria can become dysregulated , throw off ros into the cytoplasm and rip up the dna , dysregulating molecular growth pathways . then you have the tumor microenvironment , c-cell perpetuating inflammation and angiogenesis pathways for tumor growth and survival . it ’ s not all about orac , though it may contribute by cooling off ros . there are multiple inhibitors of cancer growth in food . agarwal , et al published a great 2006 paper illustrating the effect which i often share with patients . i believe daily therapeutic ( not culinary ) doses of tumeric , ginger , brassica , pomegranate juice , berries … sprout combinations i grow , garlic , onions and purple cabbage are the main vegetables i eat due to budget . during chemo , i just stopped all supplements a day or 2 before and after because i do not want to help the cell kick the drug out.orac ? oxygen radical absorbance capacity – “ oxygen radical absorption capacity ( orac ) assay measures the degree of inhibition of peroxy-radical-induced oxidation by the compounds of interest in a chemical milieu . it measures the value as trolox equivalents and includes both inhibition time and the extent of inhibition of oxidation . the assay has been used to measure the antioxidant activity of foods . ” hi readers , democracynow.org today had on special time the creators of cowspiracy . have any of you checked the numbers they are mentioning in that documentary ? if those numbers are anywhere near true then phew i need to rethink some points of view.little bit unsure what to think right now , grasping in the dark , shine some light somebody ? but what if you ’ re a vegan who has been told to take various “ isolated ” supplements like b12 , vit d & calcium and a dha / epa supplement to ensure no deficiencies when avoiding meat , dairy and fish ? i know we ’ re talking about antioxidants here , but does the advice i ’ m hearing more and more about getting your nutrition from food , not pills , apply here ? that is something that interests me also . dr. greger , when he talks about calicum , he mentions fortified foods being a source. and all the is a calcium added to almond milk for example . maybe it is different because it is a mineral. and if the almond milk is going in your smoothie with heaps of other stuff like greens , fruit , berries , then it shouldn ’ t be a problem ? b12 also makes me wonder also. but taking it in a pill is still the best option , when you consider all the baggage that comes with the other sources.john mcdougall says no to vitamin d supplements . i agree with him. an excuse to make you go outside more is good anyway.dha / epa is an interesting question because i wonder about the validity of having these levels of omega 3 for health anyway . i should look more into it . could someone send me some links ? currently , i ’ m just relying on chia , flax , hemp , walnut , pumpkin , sunflower seeds , and greens for omega 3 , 6 . currently i ’ m not taking a supplement . i ’ d consider one after having my levels tested and they turned up on the lower end.check out dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations he covers everything you list ! yes , obtain it all from food is best . sunshine , greens , beans , and flax . b12 is the only one you absolutely need . see if this helps ? thanks , josephharvard did any interesting study when they realized vegetarians have a 70 % less chance of getting cancer . ( i ’ m not good with time but i want to say less than 2 years ago . ) they were curious to what vegetarians did or not do for this spectacular percent in not getting cancer . “ leafy green vegetables , ” someone concluded . they found that chlorophyll wrapped itself around the mutagen and now the cancerous cell was too large to penetrate a healthy cell . then your body took care of it . the one thing they didn ’ t relate was how “ leafy green vegetables ” also produced an alkaline ph in one ’ s body . this also inhibits cancers , viruses and spoors . so , it seems it ’ s not just antioxidants but “ leafy green ” veggies – chlorophyll – with a more alkaline ph which will help prevent cancers with some potential to reverse the cancer . i do want to ask how veggies we should ingest daily . i get fresh fruit smoothies here in thailand ( they are great ) and i can also get a shot of wheat grass . the promo for the wheat grass says it ’ s the same as eating 1.5 kg of veggies . do i really need that much ? ps : there is growing evidence that intermittent fasting prior to chemo not only ameliorates the side effects of chemo but seems to target the cancerous cells better.daily recommendations from the usda says 3 cups . i find that number a bit low . more fruits and veggies is always a good idea in healthy individuals. antioxidants , berries , blueberries , cancer , cancer survival , chemotherapy , chronic diseases , dna damage , fruit , greens , industry influence , lifespan , lymphoma , mortality , multivitamins , non-hodgkin lymphoma , nutrient synergy , oxidative stress , ranking foods , stomach cancer , stomach health , supplements , usda , vegetables - -
30	is buying organic worth it ? a review of the science in new dvd one of the most common questions i get when i speak is “ what do you think about buying organic ? ” as with any question like this , i first try to gently explain that what i or anyone else thinks doesn ’ t really matter . what matters is the science : what the best available balance of evidence shows right now . how else could we possibly make decisions for something as critical as the health of ourselves and our families ? i put together a 5-part video series summarizing the best science comparing the nutritional content , pesticide risk , heavy metal toxicity , and food poisoning risk of organic versus conventionally raised foods , including a video on practical tips for making your own diy fruit and vegetable wash : they are all available right now as a video download as part of my new latest in clinical nutrition volume 24 ( all proceeds go to charity ) . it can also be ordered as a physical dvd . the organic food videos are all scheduled to go up on nutritionfacts.org next month , but you can download and watch them right now . i ’ m excited to announce that the downloads are now in hd and have all the chapters marked like in the physical dvd . the current batch of videos from volume 23 on nutritionfacts.org just ran out , so starting now and running through june , i ’ ll be rolling out the videos from this new dvd , volume 24 . the dvds give folks the opportunity to sneak-preview videos months ahead of time , watch them all straight through , and share them as gifts , but there is nothing on the dvds that won ’ t eventually end up free online here at nutritionfacts.org. if you ’ d like the works – 40 + hours of video – you can get the complete dvd collection . in the image above you can see the list of chapters from the new volume 24 dvd — a preview of what ’ s to come over the next few months on nutritionfacts.org. order my new dvd at drgreger.org / dvds or through amazon . it can also be ordered as a video download at drgreger.org / downloads . if you were a regular supporter , you ’ d already be an organic food expert by now , having gotten the new dvd last week ! i now come out with new dvds every 9 weeks . if you ’ d like to automatically receive them before they ’ re even available to the public , please consider becoming a monthly donor . anyone signing up on the donation page to become a $ 15 monthly contributor will receive the next three dvds for free ( as physical dvds , downloads , or both – your choice ) , and anyone signing up as a $ 25 monthly contributor will get a whole year ’ s worth of new dvds . if you ’ re already signed up and didn ’ t receive your volume 24 yet , please email tommasina @ nutritionfacts.org and she ’ ll make everything all better . if you ’ d rather just watch all the videos online as they launch , but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating , you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization nutritionfacts.org using a credit card , a direct paypal link , or by sending a check to “ nutritionfacts.org ” po box 11400 , takoma park , md 20913 . time and time again you ’ ve heard me kvetch about the corrupting role money has played in the field of nutritional science . financial considerations decide which foods get studied , which studies get published , and which findings get disseminated to the public . and when a company funds its own research , you always have to worry if the inherent conflict of interest is biasing the results . that really hit home when i was recording the video , nutritional yeast to prevent the common cold . the video ends with a concern that some brands of nutritional yeast may be contaminated with lead . dr greger , my “ kvetch ” is that you don ’ t use yiddish phrases enough ; but i love it when you do ! if you ’ re anything like me , your grandparents spoke in yiddish when they didn ’ t want your parents to understand them . your parents only learned a few yiddish phrases , and you : practically none at all . for sure , i ” ll be happy to contribute to your new research fund.די באַמערקונגען זענען דרייווינג מיך משוגע שוין ( http : / / imtranslator.net / translation / english / to-yiddish / translation / ) ; ) איך האָפֿן אַז עטלעכע פון זיי מאַכן איר לאַכן.if he wants the majority of his audience to understand him , he will continue to post the way he has been.another consideration when choosing organic , is net benefit to the environment . that ’ s important to me and millions of others.i ’ m aware that is not your focus , but it might be worth mentioning . thanks ! even that question is complicated . industrial scale organic farming uses herbicides and pesticides , just ones sourced from nature . some are benign , others less so . industrial scale organic farming has somewhat lower yields , so requires more acreage . and no-till farming is difficult with organic methods , so industrial scale organiic farming entails greater soil loss . there ’ s a world of difference between the high-labor organic farming we envision , with compost fertilization , integrated pest management , weeding by hand , and careful stewardship of the environment , and the organic farming that ’ s economically viable on a large scale .. ideally , as consumers , we ’ ll all become aware of the tradeoffs.admire your work , doctor greger !

31	orange aromatherapy for anxiety aromatherapy — the use of concentrated essential oils extracted from plants to treat disease — is commonly used to treat anxiety symptoms . anxiety disorders are the most prevalent class of psychiatric disorders in the general population . however , their treatment is challenging , because the drugs used for the relief of anxiety symptoms can have serious side effects . thankfully , credible studies that examine the effect of essential oils on anxiety symptoms are gradually starting to appear in the medical literature . however , in most of these studies , exposure to the essential oil odor was accompanied by massage . this makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effect of the aroma itself . a typical example includes this study where patients in the intensive care unit the day after open-heart surgery got foot massages with orange-scented oil . why not back massages ? because they just had their chests cracked open so they have huge sternotomy wounds . patients showed a significant psychological benefit from the aromatherapy massage . but how do we know the essential oil had anything to do with it ? maybe it was just the massage . if that ’ s the case , then great — let ’ s give people massages ! i ’ m all for more icu foot rubs . “ there is considerable evidence from randomized trials that massage alone reduces anxiety , so if massage is effective , then aromatherapy plus massage is also effective . ” one study where cancer patients got massaged during chemo and radiation even found that the massage without the fragrance may be better . the researchers thought it might be a negative pavlovian response : the patient smells the citrus and their body thinks , “ oh no , not another cancer treatment ! ” more recently the ambient odor of orange was tested in a dental office to see if it reduces anxiety and improves mood . ambient odor of orange was diffused in the waiting room and appeared to have a relaxant effect — less anxiety , better mood , and more calmness — compared to a control group where there was no odor in the air . no odor , that is , except for the nasty dentist office smell . maybe the orange scent was just masking the unpleasant odors . maybe it had nothing to do with any orange-specific molecules . more research was necessary . so in another study , highlighted in my video , orange aromatherapy for anxiety , researchers exposed some graduate students to an anxiety-producing situation and tested the scent of orange , versus a non-orange aroma , versus no scent at all . the orange did appear to have an anxiety-reducing effect . interestingly , the observed anxiety-reducing effects were not followed by physical or mental sedation . on the contrary , at the highest dose , the orange oil made the volunteers feel more energetic . so orange aromatherapy may potentially reduce anxiety without the downer effect of valium-type drugs . does that mean we can get the benefits without the side effects ? i ’ ve talked about the concerns of using scented consumer products before , even ones based on natural fragrances ( throw household products off the scent ) , and there have been reports of adverse effects of aromatherapy . alternative medicine isn ’ t necessarily risk-free . for example , there are dozens of reported cases of people having their hearts ruptured by acupuncture . ouch . but the adverse effects of aromatherapy were mostly from skin irritation from essential oils being applied topically , or even worse swallowed . certain citrus oils can also make your skin sensitive to sunlight . lavender may also help for both anxiety ( lavender for generalized anxiety disorder ) and migraines ( lavender for migraine headaches ) . the only other aromatherapy-related video is wake up and smell the saffron , though i have others on natural ways do reduce anxiety , including : natural , though , doesn ’ t always mean safe . see , for example : of course eating citrus is good too ! i have videos on reducing muscle fatigue with citrus and keeping your hands warm with citrus , but tell your doctor if you eat grapefruit . thank you for this , dr. greger . since being a vegan and using essential oils i am the healthiest i have ever been ( at 59 ) , i haven ’ t even taken an aspirin in years . thank you for doing all the research to show us the light ! ! ! what are reputable companies for essential oils ? and how do you disperse their scent throughout a home ? hmmm that is a good question i am uncertain what brands they used in the study . since you ’ re not ingesting the stuff i would think most any would do the trick . i know some folks add a few drops to a spray bottle of water and mist throughout home.i was looking for something more passive like a diffuser or something . essential oils by disreputable companies are often diluted with vegetable oils , etc . but i will look around , thanks ! i know this specific article was written about aromatherapy but is there a reason why organic , all-natural , plant-based , therapeutic grade essential oils should not be ingested ? i know that they aren ’ t regulated by the fda but many vitamins and nutritional supplements aren ’ t either … so , i was wondering if you had any opinion / experience or information on that . thanks ! hi christy , these are a couple of informative articles on the subject . the simple reason as to why they shouldn ’ t be ingested isn ’ t a matter of theory . it ’ s a matter of evidence , that essential oil ingestion has been shown to cause harm.http : / / leetea.hubpages.com / hub / essential-oil-safety-documented-side-effects-injuries-and-deaths-from-essential-oil-ingestionhttp : / / leetea.hubpages.com / hub / why-are-all-the-articles-that-suggest-ingesting-essential-oils-is-safe-written-by-young-living-sales-repsdoterra – http : / / www.doterra.com if you are really interested you can see if there is a doterra rep in your area and they can give you all kinds of information . the key to doterra is they are very careful about their oils and are of the highest quality . they are not added to with other oils , but are the pure oil . so very potent . you can dilute and mix them however you want . they are so high quality you can actually add most of them to your food . some are not good for you to ingest , however , so please read which ones are appropriate to eat . they can be infused , or directly applied to the skin , or used in cooking . not cheap but last a long time.lauren , this is a company without tear-level marketing that has excellent grade essential oils : http : / / www.nativeamericannutritionals.com / the orange oil smells delicious , i ’ ll bet — will check it out . another suggestion is to place a few drops of rescue remedy under your tongue. https : / / answers.yahoo.com / question / index ? qid = 20111219071030aarf8yxdoesn ’ t matter how pure the oil or scent it goes straight to my brain and starts disorienting it . next thing a migraine attack is starting . some scents are worse or faster working than others.i know that when i walk by my flowering citrus trees i feel better – the oranges especially . will have to try orange essential oil for my anxiety – will nerolie work , i have that.as a cancer survivor , over the years i have learned that chemotherapy and radiation can significantly increase your sense of smell . i have never read this , or seen it documented in any literature , however it it true for me , ( although i only had radiation ) . as i am now involved in a cancer support group , i have learned this is not just me , but many have reported this especially those who have undergone chemotherapy . it is actually an issue that arrises between couples living with cancer as a heightened sense of smell can make one more sensitive to smell that never bothered them before . this may be why the smell of essential oils doesn ’ t work with cancer patients . cancer patients may not be used to a change it their senses , or may actually be overwhelmed . just food for thought … alternative medicine , anxiety , aromatherapy , benzodiazepines , cancer , chemotherapy , citrus , complementary medicine , fragrance , france , fruit , massage , medications , mental health , oranges , plant-based diets , radiation , side effects , skin health , sunlight , valium - -
34	food manufacturers get to decide if their own additives are safe in 2013 , the u.s. food and drug administration announced their plans to all but eliminate trans fats from processed foods , citing a cdc statistic that the elimination of partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply could prevent more than 10,000 heart attacks and thousands of deaths every year . up until that point , trans fats enjoyed their so-called “ gras ” status : “ generally recognized as safe . ” how did these killer fats get labeled as safe ? who decides what ’ s safe ? currently , a “ generally recognized as safe ” determination is made when the manufacturer of a food substance evaluates the safety of the substance themselves and concludes that the use of the substance is safe . in other words , the company that manufactures the substance gets to determine if it is safe or not . this approach is commonly referred to as ” gras self-determination . ” to make matters worse , not only do companies not have to inform the public , they don ’ t even have to inform the fda . a company may voluntarily tell the fda they just came up with a new food additive that they ’ ve decided is safe , but are not required to do so . the cumulative result is that there are an estimated 6,000 current affirmative safety decisions which allow for more than an estimated 10,000 substances to be used in food ( see who determines if food additives are safe ? ) . in addition , an estimated 1,000 manufacturer safety decisions are never reported to fda or the public . “ manufacturers and a trade association made the remaining decisions without fda review by concluding on their own that the substances that they themselves were selling were safe . ” while manufacturers are not required to notify the fda of a “ safe determination , ” sometimes they do voluntarily notify the agency . from these notifications , researchers have been able to see which individuals companies select to make these determinations . of the 451 gras notifications voluntarily submitted to the fda , 22.4 % were made by someone directly employed by the company ; 13.3 % were made by someone directly employed by a firm hand-picked by the company ; and 64.3 % were made by a panel hand-picked by the corporation or the firm the corporation hired . are you doing the math ? yes , that means zero safety decisions were made independently . an astonishing 100 % of the members of expert panels worked directly or indirectly for the companies that manufactured the food additive in question . and those are just the ones the food companies let the fda know about . the companies also used the same in-the-pocket rent-a-scientist “ experts ” over and over , leading food industry watchdog marion nestle to ask “ how is it possible that the fda permits manufacturers to decide for themselves whether their food additives are safe ? ” it may be because many of the companies providing our daily food are corporate giants with “ political muscles that national governments would envy . ” pepsico alone spent more than $ 9 million in a single year to lobby congress . the fact that food additives like trans fats have been allowed to kill thousands of americans year after year comes as less of a surprise to those who realize that “ three of washington ’ s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work for the food industry . ” i ’ ve got three dozen videos on food additives . here are a few highlights : artificial colors : phosphates : preservatives : sweeteners : others : just as the food additive industry gets to decide which food additives are safe , the food industry holds sway over which foods are considered safe . see , for example , my video the mcgovern report . unbridled capitalism is worse than feudalism or slavery even , at least in those systems the upper classes as a whole benefit from healthy workers . capitalism makes no such considerations. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 8mxp _ wgfwqothe fox guarding the hen house . why do food manufacturers and the fda even bother going through this charade ? to deceive the public ? if so they ’ ve done a great job fooling people into thinking that all food additives are well tested and safe.too much of proteinous foods can cause high cholesterol whiich can lead to heart disease.protein forms about 15 % of our total diet.at an advanced age , eat little of protein . protein contains high cholesterol which is dangerous to the health.too much of proteinous food intake can cause high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke or cardiac arrest.chren should eat a lot of ffod containing protein . protein is good for growth and maturation in a child.s life , e.g. milk , eggs amongst others.trans fat and red dye # 40 have both fallen thru the crack on the fda ’ s additives-to -ban plate . yep , we ’ ve got the best government money can buy.it ’ s about enlightenment . knowledge is power . it is time . the day has come to pull the covers off the food / grocery / fda / healthcare / pharmaceutical conspiracy and hold them accountable with real consequences for their years of deception and crimes against humanity . enough of the hustle ! ! one option for food processors replacing trans-fats is interesterified vegetable oils , with randomized ordering of fatty acids on the triglyceride backbone . when long chain saturated fatty acids are redistributed to the sn-2 position , interesterified fats appear more atherogenic than native fats . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , reviews : 5 , 6 , 7.i ’ m afraid i ’ m not nearly as versed in the biochemistry as your are darryl . could you please tell me in a nutshell ( pun intended ) if these new fats they ’ re creating to replace trans fat are better or worse than the original ? i know that with the story of bpa , even worse substitutes supposedly took its place when companies removed it from products , so i wouldn ’ t be surprised if its happening again with trans fats.in triglycerides , the 3 positions on glycerol ( sn-1 , 2 , 3 ) where fatty acids are attached by ester bonds don ’ t have equal health effects . during digestion and as they cross cell membranes , the fatty acid in the middle position ( sn-2 ) is preserved , while the other two are removed by lipases , and the atherogenic ( plaque forming ) health effects appear largely determined by the the fatty acid at sn-2 . in lard , sn-2 is mostly occupied by atherogenic palmitate , while in most plant oils , sn-2 is usually occupied by less saturated fatty acids than the other two positions . for example , although cottonseed oil is 24 % palmitate , very little is at sn-2 . when randomized by interesterification , sn-1,2,3 each have 24 % palmitate , and the oil becomes much more atherogenic in rabbits 1 . in most cases , interesterified plant oils will redistribute more atherogenic fats to sn-2 , so when some more saturated oilsoils ( palm , cottonseed , soy ) are interesterified to increase melting point , they can be expected to be more harmful than their native forms.ahh , thank you for the explanation ! it still took me a while to digest it , but i think i get the basics of it . hopefully those in power use the science for once and don ’ t replace one bad oil with another . “ for the love of money is root of all evils . ” – 1 timothy 6 : 10.a word from the word seems appropriate here ! what should a person with very tight muscles eat ? i have had this problem since puberty at 12 and it still hasn ’ t gone away and is only getting worse at 71 . i love your website and look at it everyday . thank you so much ! hi val . gosh not entirely sure . dr. greger addresses foods like citrus and berries being good for muscle soreness so perhaps giving those a whirl ?

35	meat industry wins right to sell tainted meat in my last post , i talked about a particularly virulent strand of salmonella traced to foster farms . but while even mexico banned the importation of foster farms ’ chicken on public health grounds , it was still sold in the united states . why wasn ’ t there a recall ? how could foster farms continue to legally sell chicken contaminated with this virulent strain of salmonella ? it all goes back to supreme beef v. usda , a court case in which the meat industry sued the usda after they had the audacity to try to shut down a slaughter plant that was repeatedly found violating salmonella standards . the meat industry won . the federal appeals court ruled that it wasn ’ t illegal to sell contaminated meat ; what was illegal was the usda trying to protect the public by shutting down the plant . because normal cooking practices destroy salmonella , the presence of salmonella in meat does not render the meat “ injurious to health . ” salmonella-infected meat is thus legal to sell to the consumer . we can get infected no matter how well the meat is cooked though . according to researchers , even though consumers “ may eliminate salmonella on ready-to-cook chicken by proper cooking , they could still be exposed to and acquire a salmonella infection from cross-contamination of other foods with salmonella from raw chicken during meal preparation . ” if we measure the transfer rate from naturally contaminated poultry legs purchased in supermarkets to cutting boards in the kitchen , overall , 80 % of the leg skins in contact with the cutting board for ten minutes transferred campylobacter ( another dangerous bacteria found in chicken feces ) infection to the cutting board . and then if we put cooked chicken back on that same cutting board , there ’ s about a 30 % chance it too will become contaminated . even though people know that washing hands can decrease the risk of food poisoning , only about 2 / 3 say they actually do it . even though most people know about cross contamination , 1 / 3 don ’ t even say they wash their cutting boards . though awareness appears to be growing , even when people wash the cutting boards with hot soapy water we can still find salmonella and campylobacter ( see avoiding chicken to avoid bladder infections ) . the reason most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen than their bathroom is because people rinse their chickens in the sink , not the toilet . foster farms swore they ’ d try to reduce the number of chickens they were producing with this virulent strain of salmonella from 1 in 4 to just 1 in 20 . why not a zero tolerance policy in countries such as sweden ? because then , as the head of food safety for costco noted , “ you wouldn ’ t have a poultry industry . ” other countries have been able to raise chickens without salmonella . one industry-funded scientist complained that if the entire onus to produce safe products is placed on industry , “ it then gives the consumer no personal responsibility to handle their product correctly . ” that ’ s like a car company saying we can ’ t make safe cars because then no one will wear a seat belt . i ’ ve touched on this topic before in my videos salmonella in chicken and turkey deadly but not illegal , zero tolerance to acceptable risk , and unsafe at any feed . more on the issue of cross-contamination in : note when it comes to egg-borne infection the issue is not just cross-contamination , given salmonella can survive the most common egg cooking methods . check out my video total recall . though some meat additives may make meat safer ( viral meat spray and maggot meat spray ) , others may increase the food safety risk . see my video phosphate additives in chicken . all the more reason to adopt a vegan / vegetarian lifestyle.i ’ m so glad i gave up meat 18 years ago . however , i can ’ t seem to find effective alternatives to eggs in certain recipes for baking , and that really worries me . i guess i ’ m going to have to raise my own , and i hear its a lot of work.hi nigel . so nothing works as far as egg replacers go ? i have a long list of possible substitutions , let me know if you want to view . thanks for your comment ! josephhi joseph , i be grateful to receive that list of egg substitutes , i have a couple of ok methods but more would be better , i never use eggs though.other members may have better ideas than me , but here are several options i have found helpful : ingredient substitution chartbest , joseph “ safari can ’ t find the server ” is the message i get from this click.try this link : http : / / www.pcrm.org / pdfs / health / pcrm _ substitution _ chart.pdfcheers ! hey joseph and jj . thanks a lot . i run a blog for new vegetarians and it is always nice to be able to pass on such advices : ) i don ’ t bake a lot of things but have found ground flax seed in water let sit 10 minutes works very nicely for everything i bake . there are recipes on the web for eggless pumpkin pie and other things.thanks for the reply . i ’ ve tried the soaked flax seeds for egg white replacement when needing beaten egg whites for meringue , but they fall flat so quickly and won ’ t dry with the same crunch for pavlovas . i once tried an egg replacer for pumpkin pie , which smelled absolutely atrocious whilst baking . every time i try an egg free version of pancakes , they seem flat and lifeless.i welcome new ideas or tips , but i really enjoy beating egg whites for any recipe . i don ’ t use much of the yolk , but there is just nothing like a good ol ’ egg based cookie recipe . i really only use a few more eggs than normal at holiday times . i might get through a dozen every month or two with most of the yolks going down the drain . however , i ’ m very conscious about cracking the eggs in the sink , using only stainless steel with them , and boiling afterwards . plus , the calcium in the shells really do wonders for my rose bushes . i ’ m really considering getting a hen or two.well , if you can ’ t get your own hens , it is possible to biuy non-factory eggs almost everywhere . there are genuine free-range farms selling organic eggs , they ’ re just more expensive.hi nigel , i just googled vegan pavlovas and it popped this up . hopefully their recipe will help you out. http : / / www.icecreamandgiggles.com / 2014 / 12 / vegan-pavlova.htmlhave you heard of hampton creek ’ s “ just mayo ” ? it supposedly works amazing in cookies and other baking , and now they ’ re perfecting a scrambled egg replacement “ just scramble ” . amazing science behind these plant-based solutions : http : / / time.com / 3117300 / eggless-egg-hampton-creek-just-mayo / since we know that cross contamination is an issue , and that cooking meat only reduces risk , instead of eliminating it.isn ’ t that grounds to try to reverse the decision in surpreme beef vs usda ? i think many others felt the same way ! i do hope this is investigated more and better efforts to protect human health at put into place.for what it ’ s worth , wood protects itself with chemicals that destroy bacteria . bacteria on wooden cutting boards will be gone overnight , whereas some bacteria may remain on plastic cutting boards even after being scrubbed.the morale of the story is — don ’ t eat chicken are any other meat ! ! ! ! from the nyt ( not my opinion , at all ) http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2015 / 03 / 31 / upshot / red-meat-is-not-the-enemy.html ?

36	chicken salmonella outbreaks show food safety systems failure salmonella causes more hospitalizations and more deaths than any other foodborne illness , and it ’ s been on the rise . salmonella causes a million cases of food poisoning every year in the u.s. , and over the last decade or so the number of cases has increased by 44 % , particularly among children and the elderly . and chicken is the number one cause of salmonella poisoning . starting in spring 2012 , the centers for disease control ( cdc ) documented more than 600 individuals infected across 29 states with a particularly virulent strain of salmonella ( one in three were hospitalized ) . investigations pointed to foster farms — the sixth largest chicken producer in the us — as the most likely source of the outbreak . the cdc warned people , but nothing was done . foster farms apparently continued to pump out contaminated meat for 17 months . though there ’ s only been a few hundred cases confirmed , for every confirmed case the cdc estimates 38 cases slip through the cracks . so foster farms chicken may have infected and sickened more than 15,000 people . when usda inspectors went to investigate , they found 25 % of the chicken they sampled was contaminated with the outbreak strain of salmonella , presumed to be because of all the fecal matter they found on the carcasses . in their february 2014 issue , consumer reports published a study on the high cost of cheap chicken , finding 97 % of retail chicken breast off store shelves was contaminated with bacteria that can make people sick . 38 % of the salmonella they found was resistant to multiple antibiotics ( considered a serious public health threat by the cdc ) . consumer reports suggested the cramped conditions on factory chicken farms may play a role , and indeed new research shows the stress of overcrowding can increase salmonella invasion . the pew commission released a special report on the foster farms outbreaks , concluding that the outbreaks bring into sharp focus the ineffectiveness of usda ’ s approach to minimizing salmonella contamination in poultry products . the agency ’ s response “ was inadequate to protect public health , ” and to this day thousands of people are getting sick with this preventable foodborne illnesses . one of the pew commission ’ s recommendations is to close facilities that are failing to produce safe food and keep them closed until their products stop sending people to the hospital . what did foster farms have to say for itself ? they said that their chicken was “ safe to eat , ” that there ’ s “ no recall in effect , ” and that it is “ grade a wholesome . ” in the same breath , though , they say salmonella on chicken happens all the time . their chicken is “ grade a wholesome , ” but might kill us if we don ’ t handle it right . ( see foster farms responds to chicken salmonella outbreak ) . as outspoken food safety advocate bill marler put it , the poultry industry ’ s reaction to the presence of fecal contamination on chicken is that … sh * t happens . salmonella contamination is also a problem in the u.s. egg supply , sickening more than 100,000 people every year . see my video total recall . other pathogens in meat include yersinia enterocolitica in pork ( yersinia in pork ) , staphylococcus ( u.s. meat supply flying at half staph ) , mrsa ( mrsa in u.s. retail meat ) , hepatitis e ( hepatitis e virus in pork ) , bladder-infecting e coli ( avoiding chicken to avoid bladder infections ) , clostridium difficile ( toxic megacolon superbug ) , and campylobacter , the most common bacterial chicken pathogen ( poultry and paralysis ) . poultry appears to cause the most outbreaks , but is all chicken to blame equally ? see my video superbugs in conventional vs. organic chicken . how was it legal for foster farms to continue to ship our meat known to be contaminated with a dangerous pathogen ? see my videos why is selling salmonella tainted chicken still legal ? and chicken salmonella thanks to meat industry lawsuit . so what ’ s new about this ? my daughter is testing various kinds of meat and eggs for salmonella and e coli for her biology project in high school . i am interested to see her results.blech ! can not believe i ever ate dead rotting corpses ! if you love animals you cannot eat them ! just glad we are vegannew story on frontline “ the trouble with chicken ” more scary than michael greger , m.d. http : / / www.pbs.org / wgbh / pages / frontline / trouble-with-chicken / ? utm _ source = bestofnewsletter & utm _ medium = email & utm _ content = best _ of _ may-15 _ c & utm _ campaign = frontline _ 2015 antibiotics , cdc , center for science in the public interest , chicken , children , consumers union , elderly , factory farming practices , fecal bacteria , fecal contamination , food poisoning , foodborne illness , industry influence , meat , mortality , pew commission , poultry , salmonella , turkey , usda - -
37	viral food poisoning from pesticides ? although the most serious causes of food poisoning like salmonella come largely from animal products ( for example , most foodborne-related deaths have been attributed to poultry ) , millions of americans are sickened by produce every year , thanks to noroviruses . noroviruses can spread person-to-person via the fecal-oral route or by the ingestion of aerosolized vomit , which together may explain most norovirus food outbreaks . but a substantial proportion remained unexplained . how else can fecal viruses get on our fruits and veggies ? the pesticide industry may be spraying them on ( see norovirus food poisoning from pesticides ) . the water that ’ s used to spray pesticides on crops may be dredged up from ponds contaminated with fecal pathogens . when you hear of people getting infected with a stomach bug like e. coli from something like spinach , it ’ s important to realize that the pathogen didn ’ t originate from the spinach . intestinal bugs come from intestines . greens don ’ t have guts ; plants don ’ t poop . “ the application of pesticides may therefore not only be a chemical hazard , but also a microbiological hazard for public health . ” what is the industry ’ s solution ? to add more chemicals ! “ the inclusion of antiviral substances in reconstituted pesticides , ” researchers assert , “ may be appropriate to reduce the virological health risk posed by the application of pesticides . ” or we could just choose organic . likewise the salmonella in alfalfa sprout seeds ( see don ’ t eat raw alfalfa sprouts ) likely came from manure run-off or contaminated irrigation water . but this pesticide angle adds a whole new route for fecal pathogens to pollute produce . broccoli sprouts are safer , and organic sprouts may therefore be safer still ( see broccoli sprouts ) . organic foods may also be healthier ( see cancer fighting berries ) and don ’ t carry the potential chemical hazards associated with pesticides . see my videos : dr. greger , please write as soon as there is any research into any health differences ( including contamination issues like the salmonella on the alfalfa sprouts ) through the use of veganic permaculture practices . i am curious to learn if there is a meaningful difference with farmers who abstain from using animal-based fertilizing methods ( like cow poop and blood meal ) .here is an example of what i ’ m talking about : http : / / www.onedegreeorganics.com / why-veganic http : / / www.onedegreeorganics.com / our-farmers ^ this company sources its ingredients from farms that use vegan permaculture practicesthat would be interesting , nicole . i ’ ll be sure to bring this up . this article was more about pesticide sprays already being contaminated . the bacteria found in the nooks and crannies of alfalfa seeds likely came from manure run-off or contaminated water . obtaining alfalfa seeds from fresh water sources and clean soil ( i would assume ) lead to less pathogens.dr. gonzales , i understand that some organic farmers use chicken poop for fertilizer . correct ? how common is that practice ? i also understand that some forms of arsenic are used in chicken feed , although the fda recently banned many of those forms . do we now have to grill our local organic farmers on what they ’ re using for fertilizer ? your thoughts ? im sorry but organic food does have pesticides , too.good point , lea . i forget the numbers , but still far less amounts in organics and may be a safer route.what are you sorry for ? just because organic certification is meaningless doesn ’ t mean there is no pesticide-free food being grown anywhere . those privileged enough to have access to farmers markets and community gardens can take advantage of knowing which foods are truly pesticide-free , and the rest of us can fight for access to these things . if half of all fast food restaurants and gas stations in the us were community gardens , we ’ d all know a lot more about how our food was grown , without relying on certifications and labels.i ’ m so disgusted . sometimes i ’ m grateful for your information but not necessarily happy about it . i am just going to move out into the middle of nowhere and grow my own veggies . it ’ s final ! we could all live in one of these ( see link ) , save costs on housing and invest more in having a huge vege patch : ) i ’ ve been learning how to grow vegetables for the same reasons , and other outbreaks we had locally. http : / / www.news.com.au / lifestyle / home / professor-dumpster-is-home-after-a-year-spent-living-in-2x2m-bin / story-fneuz5ql-1227233957030after several massive recalls of spinach in recent years i was puzzled about how the plants became contaminated . after reading your article , it now makes sense that contaminated the irrigation water is the source of problem . i live in an area where , a decade ago , one local community had a serious issue with contaminated drinking water . in that case the community drinking water came from a common well.the well water was contaminated with fecal matter from agricultural run off . the end result was several deaths and a number of people hospitalized after drinking tap water . investigations found that there were multiple faults in the water treatment system , both mechanical and human in nature.after the investigation was completed , huge amounts of money were spent to upgrade the filtration and monitoring system for the community drinking water . however i can well imagine that in most agricultural situations little if any monitoring takes place for water used in irrigation . it would be easy then to imagine how fecal contamination could easily get onto plants and then directly into humans.the part of that equation which is not so directly understood is the use of contaminated water to mix pesticides . this is very counter intuitive given the fact that most fruit are grown above ground level , and one assumes normally not exposed to pathogens such as e coli . how clever of us ingenious humans to find a way to get poo on apples.then again we ’ ve also found a way to get radioactive isotopes from nuclear tests into the bones of all children born since 1950 . from that perspective i suppose poop on apples really isn ’ t such a big surprise.interesting story about the contaminated well-water . that is very unfortunate to hear . i think the folks who spray these pesticides don ’ t always have access to clean water . the regulations of water use and testing for bacteria seem slim to none . it appears we have so much contaminated water from agriculture run-off that it is hard to avoid . scary to think the industry ’ s solution is to develop another antiviral pesticide to combat the dangers of water contamination.i wonder why the workers who pick and or handle these items on the farms don ’ t get sick and act as a heads up on the contaminations ? good call . lets find some of that research . we know that animal agriculture workers have higher rates of cancers . i can only imagine that workers who are in the fields receive more exposure and suffer more risks . some folks talk about not eating pesticide-laden foods as a human rights issue , not necessary for their health . that makes sense to some degree , and i mean sure , cheaper food , but at what costs ?

what type of contaminate was present in the water ? at what stage of biological digestion was the contaminate when it was mixed with the water and how long was it mixed before spraying ? how long after spraying has the contaminated water been exposed to air and sunlight before harvest ? a big one : has it rained or has heavy dew volatized between the spraying process and the harvest ? there are so many variables that can either mitigate or magnify the effects of contamination that we must rely largely upon luck of the draw when making a purchase . personally , i am quite fearful of today ’ s agricultural products , for numerous reasons . it would be quite nice to believe that a operator who has several hundred acres to care for could conceivably put his shadow on each plant and assure that all processes took turn in an orderly and proper manner , most beneficial to consumers ; however , the reality is quite different . i personally grow enough organic food for a family and can care for each plant accurately and properly , but even this small operation is so demanding that if i attempted to add to my operation , it would be impossible to manage . considering all of the variables , i fully understand how a perfect storm of contamination and follow-up circumstances can so easily result in deadly consequences . indeed , it takes a perfect storm of prudent operating and good luck not to be infested and possibly sickened by contamination.love the post ! thanks , appin . i can only speak to my previous tiny garden in dc . it was nice being able to check every plant with my own eyes , but even then i was not abel to produce everything i needed . perhaps we need better education on farming , finding neighborhood gardens , and ways to dig-up our own yards ?

http : / / www.cdc.gov / ecoli / 2012 / o157h7-11-12 / index.html i know the spinach didn ’ t do it , but organic farming does not mean vegan farming . the cows , horses , sheep , goats , pigs , chickens , ducks and who know what other animal used in organic fertilizing do . as do the humans harvesting the processing the crops . here an article that might also shed so light on how organic spinach can become contaminated by e-coli. http : / / www.cdc.gov / ecoli / 2012 / o157h7-11-12 / index.htmlrelevant short article worth reading . it ’ s not just pesticides . “ the down and dirty on manure and food safety ” http : / / www.foodsafetynews.com / 2015 / 03 / the-down-and-dirty-on-manure-and-food-safety / there may be an advantage to mechanically harvested vegetables ( eg. much baby spinach these days , organic or conventional , is untouched by human hand ) .i soak my baby spinach or any veggie that i suspect may have crap on them in a pot of vinegar and water for about an hour before i have them for lunch . it also perks them up a bit if they are wilted.i drain the pot into a jar and put it back int he frig for the next day . i use the same solution for about 5 days before i start fresh again.vinegar can be used to remove certain pesticides and bacteria from your fresh produce . of course , you don ’ t need apple cider vinegar for this — any basic white vinegar will do . gayle povis alleman , ms , rd recommends a solution of 10 percent vinegar to 90 percent water as a bath to briefly soak produce.3 just place your veggeis or fruit in the solution , swish it around , and rinse thoroughly . just don ’ t use this process on fragile fruits ( like berries ) , since they could be damaged in the process or soak up too much vinegar through their porous skins.gary , some people alternate , in either order , vinegar and food-grade peroxide solution to kill possibly-harmful as well as beneficial bacteria . a comprehensive approach would include what i haven ’ t yet seen , a sketch of how / why shiga-toxic e. coli are evolving in such numbers in industrial agriculture.dr. greger ‘ n co … thank you for all your fine work . the article raises issues , but what do you recommend we do as a response ?

38	the reversal on fish oil are the purported benefits of fish oil supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a “ fish tale “ ? thanks to recommendations from organizations such as the american heart association that individuals at high risk for heart disease ask their physicians about fish oil supplementation , fish oil has grown into a multibillion dollar industry . we now consume over 100,000 tons of fish oil every year . but what does the science say ? a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal of the american medical association , highlighted in my video is fish oil just snake oil ? looked at all the best “ randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 ’ s on lifespan , cardiac death , sudden death , heart attack , and stroke . ” the studies told the subjects to either eat more oily fish or to take fish oil capsules . what did the study find ? overall , the researchers found no protective benefit for all-cause mortality , heart disease mortality , sudden cardiac death , heart attack , or stroke . what about for those who already had a heart attack and are trying to prevent another ? still no benefit . where did we even get this idea that omega 3 ’ s were good for the heart ? if we look at some of the older studies , the results seemed promising . for example , there was the famous dart trial back in the 80s involving 2,000 men . those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 % reduction in mortality . pretty impressive — no wonder it got a lot of attention . but people seemed to have forgotten the sequel , the dart-2 trial . the same group of researchers , and an even bigger study ( 3,000 men ) . in dart-2 “ those advised to eat oily fish and particularly those supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher risk of cardiac death . ” put all the studies together , and there ’ s no justification for the use of omega 3s as a structured intervention in everyday clinical practice or for guidelines supporting more dietary omega-3 ’ s . so what should doctors say when their patients follow the american heart association advice to ask them about fish oil supplements ? given this and other negative meta-analyses , “ our job as doctors should be to stop highly marketed fish oil supplementation in all of our patients . ” i ’ ve previously discussed fish oil supplements in the context of risks versus purported cardiovascular benefits : but if the benefits aren ’ t there , then all one is left with are concerns over the industrial pollutants that concentrate in the fish fat ( even in distilled fish oil , see is distilled fish oil toxin-free ? ) . these same contaminants are found in the fish themselves . this raises concern for adults ( fish fog ) , children ( nerves of mercury ) , and pregnant moms : why are there no comments on this article yet ? what about the omega 3using microalgea oil with dha and epa ? are they a waste of time as well ? not entirely . the microalgae dha-based seems to have comparable efficacies to that of fish oil . plus , you avoid potential contaminants that dr. greger is talking about in fish oil . dr. greger recommends omega-3 fatty acids 250 mg daily of pollutant free ( yeast- or algae-derived ) long-chain omega-3 ’ s ( epa / dha ) . more attention should be paid to this type of nutrient if balance of fats are off ( omega-3 to the omega 6 ratio ) in the diet , or folks are not consuming foods rich in omega-3 fats . more on dr greger ’ s nutrient recommendation.the fish / snake oil video ( 3 feb 2014 ) cites several papers particularly from 2012 which found no benefit ( even harm ) from n3 with respect to all-cause mortality , cardiac death , sudden death , myocardial infarction , and stroke . however , the linked doughman et al paper from 2007 claims n3 provides “ health benefits and as natural medicine in several major diseases . ” what benefits and major diseases are they referring to ? they bullet five discussion points of which # 3 : “ possible protective mechanisms of epa / dha in major diseases such as coronary heart disease , atherosclerosis , cancer and type 2 diabetes ” i don ’ t see compelling evidence stating that “ fish oil : bad ” but “ algae oil : good ” .i see some ! forgive any delays , theodore . sometimes my posts may be later generated . i am starting to see more ! i ’ ll comment . my biggest concern about relying on epidemiological studies is this : do we know enough yet to design the studies correctly ? omega 3s are extremely heat sensitive . the oils can go rancid easily – and the fats in the fish may get oxidized or not , depending on how you cook it . so unless we ’ re comparing raw apples with raw apples , we ’ ll be spending a lot of research time and money coming up with what could likely be meaningless results.if you look in the address bar you can see the release date of the article.i postponed dealing with the “ other than saturated ” fat issue for a long time because of all the confusionist talk , settled for a lets sit this one out and then act . : ) however i ’ ve come around so many articles claiming benefit for adhd or other less than optimal functioning brain afflictions , that i ’ ve settled on some 3 ’ s . there was one study that mentioned that even if fed a diet extremely high in 3 ’ s , people with certain sensitivities in the end always end up with very high 6 vs 3 in their profiles . i don ’ t understand how that comes to be , maybe the 3 ’ s get selectively burnt off or something ? the thing is that if those inevitable low 3 ’ s if , end up causing me symptoms , i ’ d rather keep using some support than have none.this site is very good at pointing average joe too a better diet , but not all of us are average joe ’ s . since we have a nutrition director now i ’ d like to ask what the fatty acid advice would be for people with adhd / autism spectrum disorders.hi arjan den hollander , can you give me a background of the studies you are referring to ? i am not too familiar with adhd and essential fats . off the top of my head i would not think the amounts would differ . have you seen dr. greger ’ s videos on adhd and food dyes ? or cow ’ s milk and autism ? a assume so since you are an above average joe ! send me some of the study links and lets see what they say about fat. thanks ! hi , i ’ d be a below average joe if anything but no i cannot give you “ the ” study , the internet is abuzz with them and i ’ ve categorized the lot as just noise , the amount of noise made me think i might be in the vulnerable category though.the balance became taking them will likely not harm me too much , severe deficits if they occur likely will , so i settled on a fish first or some oils every now and then.that sentiment still stands for me , as it will for a lot of people google fish oil and adhd : about 696,000 results ( 0.60 seconds ) internet abuzz is no understatement as you can see.i haven ’ t used milk in a year , only wfpb . and at this time haven ’ t eaten anything animal based for 6 weeks . never really been a candy ( color ) or artificial sugar person , not a big refined sugar consumer either for that matter.hello the minimum people should consume daily is 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds to meet the minimum 4000mg omega3 daily requirement to live . no personal advice is permitted in this forum , but since you insist : you are doing fine with with 15g walnuts and 15g of flax . greger , mcdougall , barnard and others low fat vegans will flip and call that a high fat diet , that ’ s why gonzalez didn ’ t answer you yet . if you want to hit 50g daily , i would tell you to add cacao to the ground flax seeds and walnuts and wet the mixture with raw organic coconut oil , add raisins , craisins or banana for delicious chocolate pudding.hi , thanks for your reply . if i add this all up i end up getting 15 % of my energy intake from fats . the swank people themselves set the value at 40 -50 gr . i ’ m 95 kg @ 1.86 body fat about 15 % , i ’ m not very active overall but i do as much short moderate bursts of activity as my personal weaknesses allow me to do , i try never to stall for more than 30 – 45 min.in what universe is 15 % fat much ? i need to go even lower ? hi , thanks for your reply . if i add this all up i end up getting 15 % of my energy intake from fats , i eat a lot . the swank people themselves set the value at 40 -50 gr . i ’ m 95 kg @ 1.86 body fat about < / = 15 % , i 'm not highly active overall but i do as much short moderate bursts of activity as my personal weaknesses allow me to do , i try never to stall for more than 30 – 45 min . given what i eat i suspect i burn at least 3000 but probably 3500 calories a day.in what universe is 15 % fat much ? i need to go even lower ? the 15 gr flax and walnuts are non negotiable , 400 grams ( dry weight ) of rice / oats / quinoa packs 15 grams of fat all in itself.oh and cacao for me cannot be more than a few fresh ground nibs through my 1 cup of coffee a day . i get very more more vulnerable to mania , especially if i combine it with physical activity or fun reads / shows / good humor . sounds jummy though : ) the flax seeds and walnuts are great sources of omega3 . if we don ’ t eat animal products or any other oils except a little unadulterated extra virgin olive oil or a little raw organic coconut oil we can get adequate omega3 from flax seeds , walnuts and greens . ground flax seeds can be mixed into anything . ground flax seeds with tomato sauce is a ground beef substitute , a meat sauce substitute that people cannot tell the difference when served with whole grains and beans . i eat as much avocado , seeds and walnuts as you , i am into good fat . i don ’ t believe dean ornish never eats avocado , walnuts and flax seeds . i always wonder whether low fat vegans really avoid these good helpful fats . i await their response to this conversation.i especially appreciate advice on how to prepare things and what combinations to do for flavor and function.personal advice is encouraged on the forum ! and just for the record i don ’ t consider myself a “ low fat vegan . ” but your thoughts and feedback are always welcome , rivka , as are everyone else ’ s . thanks so much for everyone ’ s participation and for making nutritionfacts.org a thiving community of ideas ! could it be that switching to a wfpbd should come with a cautionary warning when on medications ? dr. greger , would you care to comment on tbatts666 and me in this topic ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / testing-your-diet-with-pee-purple-cabbage / proper nutrition is important and as you point out in previous post there is variation in populations . so one size doesn ’ t fit all . when one is on medications it is always best to work with your prescribing professional when making lifestyle changes . the problem is that my industry is much better about getting folks onto meds than discussing the potential problems and lifestyle alternatives . psychiatric medicines pose many challenges due to lack of data on long term effects and withdrawal problems . i recommend that those interested in these areas … psychiatric illness and psychiatric medications read robert whitaker ’ s , anatomy of an epidemic , and breggin ’ s , psychiatric drug withdrawal : a guide for prescribers , therapists , patients and families . after reading these books and working with patients i have found that all these medications should come with warnings on long term ( i.e. over 4-6 weeks ) usage of these medications regardless of diet . in my experience adjusting psychiatric medications needs to be done with the guidance of a knowledgeable practitioner with support from patient and their support network.it can also be very helpful to get connected to peer-support groups . re-thinking psychiatry has been great for me in portland , oregon , as has heaving voices networks . icarus responded with a volunteer visitor for a family member who was inpatient . researching the work of open dialogue has also been helpful . it isn ’ t just diet that needs attention in these difficult times . i am an exercise instructor , and i am well aware one can over-dose on exercise , as it can trigger endorphins and other endogenous biochemicals that are addictive . this process in a reason anorexia is so difficult to treat for conventional medicine . the interaction of exercise and endocrine function is not as well understood as it should be , though some coaches know to counsel injured athletes that they may suffer withdrawal syndromes if they cannot get the workouts they are used to.yeah , try to find one of those , especially on a limited income ! trying to get off celexa after many years turned into a nightmare and the only “ advice ” i can get is keep taking it , other than the million plus suggestions online ! survivingantidepressants.org is an online community with lots of support for those looking to get off antidepressants.but since urinary ph is inherently changes with switching too a wfpbd and this clearly influences metabolism of these stimulants , i am openly requesting nutritonfacts.org puts up a cautionary addendum on all topics adhd / stimulants / high fiber vegan / wfpb.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = rybni0kb1bg they might end up getting forced into taking full doses while the dose which is based on the old diet.so , dr greger , does this mean you support her recommendation to eat coconut oil and her other tips ? you use the words may and might in every fact in your book . you also use the words may and might in tweets and in the first three words of your email newsletter subject where these qualifying words don ’ t belong at all . you michaelgregermd may be able to get over with giving direct advice but a dietician , a nutritionist , a pharmacist can ’ t . non profits can ’ t get donations to give health advice . it can be a thriving community of ideas that is applicable as general knowledge and individuals can decide for themselves . don ’ t use the words “ advice ” or “ counseling ” you can tell what the science says and you can qualify with “ may ” and “ might ” before askthedietician gives advice , if you don ’ t believe me , ask the lawyer . so 2 tablespoons ground flax seeds daily is what ? low fat ? high fat ? adequate good fat ? you have no comment or complaint about 2 tablespoons ground flax seeds daily ; it must be adequate good fat , not too much , not too little ! i ’ m not sure you ’ ve actually read or viewed many of the videos on this forum , rivka . dr. greger promote flax and walnuts and other nut consumption . if anything , consumption of oils ( a refined food ) is downplayed.i viewed the videos . he is very conservative with nuts and seeds portions . low fat high fat very subjective unless there is some science we haven ’ t heard yet . he is scared of too much fat and so are all the researchers.in the last few days we learned from the med diet videos that 30g of nuts daily ( and veggies ) provided stat sig benefit ( particularly walnuts although several other nuts also produced negative hazard risk from all causes ) . dr greger since at least 2011 has recommended “ 250 mg daily of pollutant free ( yeast- or algae-derived ) long-chain omega-3 ’ s ( epa / dha ) ” .animal fats , saturated fats , cholesterol , and transfats are to be avoided ( ideally 0 g ) . unsaturated fats should be consumed in moderation ( i don ’ t recall upper or lower limit recommendations ) .last month we learned in “ flax seeds for hypertension ” that we want sbp < 115 mmhg , that sbp may be " the single most important determinant for death in the world today " and that 30 g of ground flax seed daily sig reduced sbp by about 10-15mmhg . if our blood pressure is above 115 , we may want to consider the following daily : * 250 mg yeast of algae epa + dha * 30 g walnuts or other nuts ( 3.6 g ala , 11.5 g la ) * 30 g ground flax seeds ( about 7 g ala ) which is roughly a 1 : 1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 and 200 kcal ( or 10 % of a typical daily diet ) from these essential fatty acids.my experience is that this regimen is not effective for most people because of the low or non-existent conversion rate of short chain omegas to their long chain equivalents . realize that humans have no need for the short chain omegas found in the plant foods you cite . humans require only long chain omegas which they normally get from fish and minimally might get from plant foods.there is only one way to determine whether the individual is getting enough long chain omegas in the optimal 1 : 1 ratio and that is through serum testing which is accurate mature technology available from several labs in the usa . my experience has been that everyone blindly consuming omega 3 plant foods is being mislead which shows up when they get tested . most plant sources of omega 3s are a waste of time for most people.take some enzymes or leafy greens with ground flax seeds if you can ’ t convert the fats to active dha and epa . the fish are fukushima-ed and toxic from everything else , we have to make the plant sources work.rita , your suggestions may prove helpful . but my overriding point is that nearly all vegans who eat plant sources of omega 3s are terribly deficient in their ratio . in fact , my experience with several runner friends is that , with all the chia , flax , walnuts , etc they consume , they have the same terrible ratio as sad dieters – about 1 / 14 . it is a rude awakening to find this out . assuming consuming these foods will optimize or even improve one ’ s ratio is the height of folly . responses to different regimens varies considerably with the individual . the only way to determine a personal ratio is with lab testing.rivka , what enzymes are you suggesting – digestive enzymes ? and how do leafy greens help convert ala to long chain 3s ? are you talking about leafy greens as a source or as a catalyst of some sort ? hey stephen , can you clarity what short chained omegas you are referring to ? humans do have a need for ala ( omega 3 ) and la ( omega 6 ) . these are the essential fatty acids our body ’ s can only obtain from foods . i agree with you that the conversion rates vary widely and it is clear we do need sufficient epa and dha . i am glad you are finding testing that works for you.dear dr gonzales , thanks for requesting clarification . i welcome the opportunity to discuss the omega 3 / 6 ratio issue with an aggressive health professional like you . i ’ ve been researching it for about 2 years through reading the literature and personal testing.in all my reading , there has been universal agreement that optimizing the long chain omega 3 / 6 ratio has a strong protective effect for chronic disease in the general public . beyond that is where i have detected problems.my tentative conclusion is that the public is being seriously mislead by ubiquitous ineffective omega dietary advice . my perspective comes from the aviation and fleet maintenance industries where oil sample analysis is highly accurate at detecting anomalous wear patterns that predict equipment failure long before it occurs . in a like manner , serum gas spectroscopy testing is mature reasonably priced technology that can map out every fatty acid in a serum sample . so computing the omega 3 / 6 ratio for this technology is a slam dunk . not just “ for me ” , testing is the only method anyone should use to determine their omega status . popular advice is the equivalent of pouring oil in your engine by guessing rather than using a dipstick – not a good idea.my present suspicion is that nearly everyone following a plant-based diet with foods high in short chain omega 3s like flax and walnuts is no better than average for their long chain omega 3 / 6 ratio which is 1 / 14 and that is terrible . it gets worse . the ratio is only part of the issue . the level of omega 3s is also very important . without the proper level , not enough omega 3s get into cells no matter what the ratio is . testing can determine the level too.have you had your serum omega status tested recently and , if so , what is it ? there are a number of labs doing this testing . i can make a recommendation if you like . why not invite dr greger to test too if he has not done so and publish the results.in summary , my position is , it is inaccurate and irresponsible to recommend dietary sources of short chain omega fatty acids like flax and walnuts the way so many popular articles do because it misleads the public into thinking that somehow optimizes their long chain omega 3 / 6 ratio . not true . dr greger ’ s recommendation for algae base supplementation , while “ functionally equivalent ” to the long chain omegas from fish , will likely turn out to be woefully inadequate for optimization for most people . the only way to determine the individual ratio is through testing . everyone ’ s motto should be : don ’ t guess . test ! i can speak further on the subject of optimization – another knotty subject – once you guys have published your ratios.an excellent national institutes of health lecture by dr william lands is available here : https : / / youtu.be / kivrynjixk8stephen albers ‘ be sure to listen to parts 3 and 4 of this video by dr. landis . that gives a much clearer picture.you are welcome ! anyone is always free to share their ideas or research here ! that is the point of our website ! dr gonzales , one of the researchers i contacted had developed an equation for estimating the proper dosage of epa / dha needed to reach a particular serum ratio . after confirming that a salmon regimen would drastically lower my ratio from 1 / 14 to 1 / 2 , i began a new regimen based solely on dr greger ’ s recommended algae based supplement with an amount based on the equation . the researcher called the epa / dha golden algae source “ functionally equivalent ” to fish sources . he also said that nutrition research into the millions of different algae strains is just beginning and stressed that algae are one of the oldest known life forms on this planet . it will take about 60 days for me to receive test results from this plant-based supplementation regimen.so just to be sure , are you talking about long chain omega 3 ’ s for brain health or for heart / artery health ? are you suggesting that the longevity studies for the mediterranean diets were based on the effects of long chain ratios ? jeff , thanks for your question . keep in mind i ’ m a consumer , not a medical expert . but , based on my considerable reading , the body has no need for short chain efas except for converting them to long chain efas which the body uses . by supplementing with long chain efas ( epa / dha ) the need for short chain efas from flax , hemp , chia , walnuts , etc disappears . since short chain efas are poorly converted to long chain efas in everyone and not converted at all in some people , focusing on them is not appropriate . the focus for all health benefits should be on long chain efas which are obtainable from fish or vegan source golden algae supplements . the amount of supplementation should be adjusted to obtain the desired ratio as revealed by serum testing.i am not a doctor either , but my understanding is that omega 3s also help reduce the amount of aa that is made out of omega 6s because uptake of omega 3 aids with release of excess omega 6 . i think that aa promotes inflammation.why do people continue to suggest to others to eat coconut oil when dr. greger keeps warning against it bcuz of the high saturated fat content . plus , consuming high n ~ 6 will block n ~ 3 eaten at the same time . and , plant based n ~ 3 doesn ’ t convert efficiently . so , while i am not a doctor and wouldn ’ t presume to give out advice , i can say that i think what you ’ re recommending is incorrect information.good question , i found a flaw in the study that @ michael _ greger _ md : disqus refers to as the basis for his “ coconut oil is bad for you ” video . this featured in his nutrition dvd more than 5 years ago as far as i can remember . the study was giving margarine to all 3 groups ( safflower , butter and coconut ) which we all know does raise your cholesterol , and the coconut group received an extra serving of hydrogenated coconut cream . we all know that is transfat , you can take any healthy oil and hydrogenate it and i will be bad for you . apart from margarine ( for what reason they were giving this beats me , well the only reason i see it so skew the results to show coconut is bad ) the other two groups were given non-hydrogenated servings of safflower oil and butter , only coconut group was given oil and hydrogenated cream . i read the paper that dr greger provides with his dvd . when i argued about this with a “ blind follower ” ( no issues with dr greger this guy kept saying that he cannot be wrong when dr greger was humble enough to admit otherwise ) of dr. greger. he refused to accept and then said you can contact dr greger he will respond . cut a long story short i told him to contact dr greger and he did and dr greger responded ( i hear he always does so kudos to him ) and he admitted “ the cohorts were wrong ” in that study . so i don ’ t understand why dr greger still carries this study that he admitted was wrong . if coconut or coconut oil was bad for you entire south india would have been extinct “ if coconut or coconut oil was bad for you entire south india would have been extinct ” by the same logic , “ if saturated fat , cholesterol , or transfat was bad for you , the entire modern world would have been extinct . ” indeed , we ’ re headed in that direction.how long has the modern world been consuming transfats ? sorry your point is devoid of logic please don ’ t try to argue if you have not idea what is the consumption of coconut in south india . they have been consuming coconut for thousands of years . transfats consumption has only become mainstream in the 1960 it was only invented in 1890 as far as i remember . everything is coconut . all 3 meals coconut chutney and everything cooked in coconut oil and deserts made from coconut . infact most vegetarians at one point ( before the formation of the dairy industry that resulted in cold chain supply ) were vegan they were using only coconut milk.we sure can see the modern world riddled with diseases . in south india only in the last few decades diseases have increased . we never get to hear that those in south india were living comfortable till 100 til the last generation . my own great grandmother lived to be 104 years and 99 she travelled alone 1500 km to reach my grandmas house in bombay where she died.i am curious why did you only choose to address this because it seemed easy to argue ; - ) . lets address the facts that why trans fat was fed to the coconut group double than the other two groups and why @ michael _ greger _ md : disqus after admitting the studies were wrong is still carrying this on his website . here is a lot of research done on coconut oil that is peer reviewed but in india http : / / coconutboard.nic.in / cnoqulty.htm at the bottom of each of the pages you will find the research papersi don ’ t appreciate the personal attack . i am not obligated to engage and address all of your points . i only countered your absurd hyperbole with another hyperbole . extinction requires 100 % fatality . so , it matters not if a population has lived for thousands of years or one generation . saturated fat does not lead to extinction but is implicated in sub-optimal health.whether coconut oil has other great benefits or whether there are cofounding problems with other sources of saturated fat ( such as cholesterol and proteins in dairy ) is an interesting discussion for which i have little to contribute . i will allow those more knowledgable to jump in . until then , i remain sceptical of pro-coconut research put forth by the coconut board of india.wow you sure are a # troll then . you are the one attacking me for a casual statement . it was hyperbole i never meant or even imagined that they could go extinct . and you had to # troll me for that . you are the only one attacking here . the coconut board is only listing down research done by research centers in india . they do not do any inhouse research . you are being cynical . you did not even bother to check where the studies are from . stop trolling if you don ’ t have time to even read the links go back under your bridgethanks for your post ! please send me the links you are referring to , or any reference that you feel is incorrect and we ’ ll take a look ! it is because of folks like you we ’ re able to alter our information and stay current on the science.thanks so much ! josephthis is the study on nutritionfacts.org that says coconut oil is no better than butter when it comes to cholesterol. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries / someone has posted a link here . i have read this study in the 2007 nutrition dvd of @ michael _ greger _ md : disqus as he attaches all the pdfs of the studies i found this flaw. here is the study http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9756121 my friend even wrote to dr greger more than 5 years ago and dr greger admitted it was a mistake . back then this website did not exist ( rather it was not the same website ) but when this website was started in this avatar that study was included . we can clearly see in the study that that the groups ( the full study was in dr gregers dvd ) that all 3 groups were given margarine which we know raises cholesterol . but the coconut group was also given hydrogenated coconut cream . this is why the coconut group did just a little better than the butter group obviously if you gave it two servings of hydrogenated fat it still was not the worst . i don ’ t know why you guys keep demonizing coconut oil based on these flawed studies.thanks for reposting your questions and finding that study . from what i see not all of the citations from this video involves studies that only used hydrogenated coconut oil . one study that dr. greger profiles in the video you linked actually mentions some of your concerns regarding other studies that use hydrogenated oil in the introduction section . if interested you can read here.i don ’ t think dr. greger is saying that coconut oil be shunned completely . i took this straight from the transcripts . “ walt willett ’ s recommendation from harvard , if you are going to use it use it sparingly . now look , if you ’ re eating so healthy that your ldl cholesterol is under 60 or 70 , then i don ’ t see coconut oil as a problem . unlike saturated animal fats , coconut oil doesn ’ t cause that spike inflammation immediately after consumption of animal foods , which makes sense because as you ’ ll remember it may be the dead bacterial endotoxins in animal products ferried into the body by saturated fat that are to blame . ” i hope that helps a bit . please keep us posted should another study arise , just post it on the website for discussion.thanks , josephi think its giving out the wrong message to include a flawed study or rather a study that was aimed at demonizing coconut oil by whatever industry. here are some more studies conducted in india http : / / coconutboard.nic.in / cnoqulty.htm at the bottom you can see the studies especially in south india coconut oil has been consumed as a staple for thousands of years . no way coconut can be called unhealthy unless you are talking about oil which in case every oil is unhealthy . there is not need to pick on coconut oil . i think you should make a video on your views @ disqus _ wnyoils4ks : disqus which is very true . i just find it sad to see today coconut oil being demonized and an oil that was not even edible once is being touted as a healthy oil ( i am speaking about canola which is nothing rapeseed oil which was used as an industrial oil . it has high ueric acid and was actually used to adulterate its cousin mustard oil in india and had caused deaths ) whats even more appalling that many people believe that coconut oil ( along with cashews ) contain cholesterol its all a result of these fraudulent studies conducted by the “ hydrogenated fat industry ” few decades ago so they could replace the coconut oil in the food / baking industry with margarine.i ’ ll update the info on coconut oil in a q & a. please check back within a week to see my response here.thanks for the follow-up . i think flawed study or not it was still published and i don ’ t feel we ’ re giving our the “ wrong ” information when dr. greger is simply relaying information from the studies . as i mentioned , the researchers themselves in one study we reference are asking the same q
40	are multivitamins just a waste of money ? about one in three americans take a multivitamin . is that helpful , harmful , or just a harmless waste of money ? in 2011 , the iowa women ’ s health study reported that multivitamin use was associated with a higher risk of total mortality , meaning that women who took a multivitamin appeared to be paying to live shorter lives . but this was just an observational study — researchers didn ’ t split women up into two groups and put half on multivitamins to see who lived longer . all they did was follow a large population of women over time , and found that those that happened to be taking multivitamins were more likely to die . but maybe they were taking multivitamins because they were sick . the researchers didn ’ t find any evidence of that , but ideally we ’ d have a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled trial , where thousands were followed for over a decade , with half given a multivitamin and half a placebo . that ’ s what we got the following year in 2012 with the harvard physicians ’ study ii . and after a decade , the researchers found no effect on heart attack , stroke , or mortality . the accompanying editorial concluded that multivitamins are a distraction from effective cardiovascular disease prevention . the message needs to remain simple and focused : heart disease can be largely prevented by healthy lifestyle changes . the researchers did , however , find that for men with a history of cancer , the multivitamin appeared to be protective against getting cancer again , though there was no significant difference in cancer mortality or cancer protection in those who ’ ve never had cancer before . still , that ’ s pretty exciting . it is just one study , though . ideally we ’ d have maybe 20 of these placebo-controlled trials and then compile all the results together . that ’ s what we got in 2013 — a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that analyzed twenty-one trials and more than 90,000 individuals . the analysis found no influence on mortality either way . some found more cancer mortality , some found less cancer mortality , but all in all it was a wash . and that was heralded as good news . after the iowa women ’ s health study came out we were worried multivitamins could be harming millions of people , but instead they don ’ t appear to have much effect either way . the accompanying editorial asked whether meta-analyses trump observational studies . the iowa women ’ s health study followed tens of thousands of women for nearly 20 years . what if we put all the studies together , the big observational studies along with the experimental trials ? and that ’ s what we got in december 2013 . the review for the u.s. preventive services task force , highlighted in my video , should we take a multivitamin ? found that multivitamins appear to offer no consistent evidence of benefit for heart disease , cancer , or living longer . but aren ’ t vitamins and minerals good for us ? one explanation for this result could be that our bodies are so complex that the effects of supplementing with only one or two components is generally ineffective or actually does harm . maybe we should get our nutrients in the way nature intended , in food . the accompanying editorial to the december 2013 review concluded that enough is enough . we should stop wasting our money on vitamin and mineral supplements . americans spend billions on vitamin and mineral supplements . a better investment in health would be eating more fruits and vegetables . imagine if instead we spent those billions on broccoli ? i ’ ve previously addressed multivitamins in my videos are multivitamins good for you ? and multivitamin supplements and breast cancer ( with a follow-up in my q & a is multivitamin use really associated to an increased risk of breast cancer ? ) . i also touched on potential risks in dietary theory of alzheimer ’ s . with the exception of vitamins d and b12 ( vitamin supplements worth taking ) , we should strive to get our nutrients from produce , not pills . what about fish oil supplements ? check out is fish oil just snake oil ? i think that a * good * multivitamin is more cost-effective for vegetarians and vegans than taking separate vitamin b12 & d supplements – one pill is easy to remember ; studies have routinely demonstrated that medication compliance / adherence drops rapidly as the number of required pills and permutations rises.yes but two vitamins is easy to remember . vitamins b12 and d are quite inexpensive too . plus the message here is that multivitamins might do more harm than good . we didn ’ t evolve taking in large doses of a few select vitamins and minerals . there are literally thousands of compounds in foods that work together in out bodies like a symphony . if the violin starts overtaking the rest of the instruments then the music falls apart . t. colin campbell ’ s book whole discusses this in great detail . worth a read.i tried to take b12 but it gave me bad canker sore . i appreciate any suggestion.a multivitamin and mineral supplement is convenient and cost-effective , but , like most things in life , it ’ s a compromise . most multivitamins have a lot of pre-formed vitamin a , which is not water soluble and therefore can ’ t be excreted from the body . the body can ’ t store it either , meaning it could be poisonous . the better way to get vitamin a is as beta-carotene . even that is better to get from food . ( in smokers , admittedly a high-risk group , supplemental beta-carotene has been shown to increase lung-cancer risk . ) for vitamin e , most multivitamin products have racemic alpha-tocopherol . naturally occurring vitamin e is a family of compounds , all members of which are chiral and only one enantiomer of each occurs in nature , so taking alpha-tocopherol doesn ’ t meed the body ’ s need of vitamin e. a typical multivitamin contains 100 % rda of folic acid . in the us refined grains are fortified with folic acid . ( unrefined ones naturally contain folic acid . ) so , taking a multivitamin can result in folic acid overdose . a typical multivitamin doesn ’ t have enough vitamin d. the other issue is trace minerals : multivitamins typically have either too much trace minerals or too little , both of which could be dangerous . i used to take a multi but now take carefully selected individual nutrients . “ multivitamins are a distraction from effective cardiovascular disease prevention ” : it ’ s important to keep that in mind ! the danger of a non targeted supplementaton like multivitamins is that it gives a false sens of security , and so often mislead away from a healthy diet . pills are so convenient ! it ’ s an easy excuse for not going to the market , not cooking , save time , save energy , and so on … is this the centrum study ? that ’ s not a multivitamin it ’ s synthetic garbage : - ) . diet and lifestyle is paramount to good health but investing in a supplement that is preferably food based as an added layer of protection should not be discouraged especially in an era when our soils and subsequently foods are depleted.yes , supplement quality is so important . it sounds like this article is just about multivitamins , but what about minerals ? i think for those who eschew animal foods , getting sufficient absorbable zinc , selenium and iron ( women ) can often be a challenge.a handful of pumpkin seeds for zinc ; a couple of brazil nuts for selenium ; and lots of dark green leafy vegetables like kale or spinach for iron . these foods also have an abundance of phytonutrients not found in pills . it needn ’ t be as much of a challenge as an adventure in eating more variety than ever before.lentils , soybeans and blackstrap molasses are high in iron . vit c helps with absorption.one gets what they pay for . if you buy a cheap vitamin that is made from synthetic vitamins and minerals and won ’ t dissolve in a cup of vinegar for days , its likely to have little or no impact . however , i you invest in a plant-based vitamin made from whole plant foods that does dissolve in vinegar in minutes , then what would the results be . doing research that is super broad and general is much different that specifically listing which company and vitamins are being researched . those in the vitamin business would agree that there is lots of crap on the market , but that does not mean its all crap . many vitamin takers believe in eating a whole food plant based diet as well . most americans for sure , eat a crummy diet , many of them are not even aware its crummy , so therefore a quality plant-based vitamin may be of assistance . lets just end with this , a yugo is a car , and so is a lexus , the comparison ends right there . there is a vast difference between the two and comparing safety , quality , driver satisfaction and beyond in almost every thinkable category there is no comparison . writing any kind of research that begs them into the same pot greatly diminishes what a quality manufacturer actual produces . i could be wrong but i believe similar thinking applies to the ‘ vitamin ’ category as well.there are good and bad multi-vitamins and i would like to know what kind of vitamins were used in the study . most otc vitamins don ’ t work , and i know that for a fact ! you have to take multi-vitamins that are pharmaceutical graded and you have to take them twice a day , with food , to be absorbed properly .. one-a-day vitamins will never work since the potent vitamin c and all of the b-complexes will be flushed out of your body after about 8-10 hours since they are water solvable . then free-radicals take over your healthy cells one of the main purposes of taking multi-vitamins is to increase your levels of antioxidants . when your body is saturated with antioxidants , and you have reduced your free-radical gap ( range ) to a minimum , you have removed the gap where infections , inflammations , and abnormal cell damage happens . i use a biophotonic scanner , using raman spectroscopy , to measure the carotenoid molecules in your skin . the carotenoid is a bio-marker for overall antioxidant protection , and the denser the molecules , the better your cellular health ( immune system ) is . i have scanned vegans , vegetarians etc , and even if they score higher than average , they still have a free-radical gap and have ways to go to before their body is saturated with antioxidants . this scanner was developed by university in utah and is a scientifically sound and protected device . lester packard , one of the most acknowledged antioxidant specialist , recommends that everyone should get scanned , increase their score to the max , and maintain their max number to stay healthy . i have eating a healthy , plant-protein diet and also taken supplements that works , and have not been sick in the last five years i have been doing this.interesting ! what supplements have worked to reduce your free-radical gap using raman spectroscopy ? in “ the antioxidant miracle ” dr. lester packer recommends lipoic acid , coq10 , vitamins e and c. what new ones has he recommended over the last 16 years since the book was published ? hi thomas ! dr. packard wrote this paper after he was introduced to the scanner by pharmanex in 2002 . he recommends the lifepak line of supplements which are also in the pdr . it is especially lifepak nano that is the most potent supplement since it is encapsulated in nano technology for better absorption. https : / / dl.dropboxusercontent.com / u / 97182049 / lesterpackerandthescanner.pdfunfortunately , dr. greger has chosen to ignore the plethora of positive studies regarding supplementation . as such , though i agree with eating well wholeheartedly ( though not exclusively plant based ) , i choose to unsubscribe as my needs are not being met due to doctor bias.i believe dr greger ( research ) pretty must is sticking with b12 and vitamins d depending on how close you live to the equator . do you have other studies that demonstrate that supplements are needed ? hi veganrunner ! here is an interesting journal to why supplementation is needed : http : / / whybioscan.com / wp-content / uploads / 2013 / 09 / 2002-06-19-jamaclinicalapplications1.pdfit appears that editorial was written before this meta. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17327526ira , please follow through and post links to a few of those studies . but don ’ t shoot the messenger — dr. greger is just reporting what ’ s out there . he does feel supplementation of vitamins d and b12 can be a positive thing.first of all : isolated nutrients can never be as beneficial as those absorbed from food with their associated co-factors . “ the whole is more than the sum of their parts . ” and : how uneducated and incompetent or ignorant , but in any way dilettante must “ scientists ” be if they do not even distinguish between regular synthetic- , active synthetic- and whole-food vitamins ? ? ? ! ! ! it ´ s just like the wide spread ignorance of the difference of recommended dietary allowance ( rda ) , the recommended daily intake ( rdi ) or the daily value ( dv ) , which are just the daily intake levels of nutrients that are considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97 – 98 % of healthy individuals , which means the minima required , so humans who are not under stress do not suffer from a deficiency , which is far from the optimum levels – or the ignorance that tiny amounts of essential trace elements can make the difference of health or illness or even death.most are one-track specialists , and thus little more than amateurs – just like the politicians , the voters , or those who invest their money in funds and corporations , without knowing the devastating effects of their activities on the environments , humans and the entire society , humankind.until the fda regulates vitamins like they do medications i will not take a vitamin pill . i take only those not provided in whole foods like d3.maybe they are just the people who think the easy out of good nutrition is by taking a pill . i thought that eating fish was the way to get b12 and vit d , but i am now recovering from mercury poisoning.iodine ( actually iodide ) , in addition to vitamins b-12 and and d , is not reliably found in most plant foods , with the exception of sea vegetables , and should be included in a discussion of nutrients that may need to be gotten through supplementation or food fortification for vegans . even a sheet of nori delivers only about 1 / 3 of the rda for iodine . and the salt used by the food industry is typically not iodized . a high quality multi-vitamin / mineral supplement will include all three.steve : i don ’ t know whether i agree with your conclusion or not ( focusing on taking a single multi-supplement ) , but dr. greger would agree ( at least he did in 2011 ) with your point about iodine . here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations , including the few nutrients he calls out , such as iodine : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / i read it and he says iodine needs to be supplemented for persons not consuming sea vegetables . he does say that kelp has too much iodine , but why can ’ t people eat but a pinch of it . my diet is still not perfect and i do consume iodized salt.the book “ vegan for life ” recommends iodine supplementation because of the inconsistent quantities in sea vegetables . i discovered that i may have a deficiency.yes , iodine should be a concern because most people get from iodized salt . but what happens if you eat neither table salt or sea weed ? heck , it ’ s not even included in most multi-vitamins.in an ideal world , i believe what dr. greger proposes in the way of getting most all nutrients from foods would be best . furthermore , as a graduate of the program that dr. colin campbell did in cooperation with cornell university , i am also an advocate of a more holistic approach to nutrition , as opposed to the reductionist method of isolating individual micronutrients . however , we live in a world where our food , our environment , and the ability of our bodies to assimilate nutrition have all , for various reasons , been compromised , amounting to a net decrease in assimilated nutrients . we could argue we would all be better off without electricity because it isn ’ t natural , and if we could manage to get up at dawn to work and be in bed early , it might arguably be healthier . unfortunately , it ’ s not the way most of us live . from my own experience , at this point i believe the addition of some basic vitamins and minerals through non-synthetic , whole food-based supplements can be valuable for many people . this is especially true as people age , and their abilities to absorb nutrients from the food declines . of course , i believe that a good and balanced diet based on organic plant-based food is a precursor for health , and supplements cannot compensate for diets that create disease rather than health . however , i wouldn ’ t throw the baby out with the bath water when it comes to whole-food supplements , and the good they may do to help rectify possible nutritional shortcomings that may exist for people eating even the most well-planned plant-based diet.you might find the video link below interesting comparing a whole food broccoli supplement to broccoli sprouts.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / broccoli-sprouts-vs-supplements / interesting study , although again , it is the often done comparison of whole foods vs supplement . we know there are many co-factors in whole foods that isolated nutrients are missing , hence their lack of bioavailability . what though if we use supplements for exactly what their name suggests ; to supplement our diet together with those foods that contain the co-factors ? obviously , when it comes to nutrients , the shotgun approach , or more is better approach , isn ’ t good . however , what if a person is eating a very balanced whole food , plant-based diet , and tests still show deficiencies in certain nutrients ? or what if their bodies , skin , nail , hair , etc . , would indicate some dietary deficiency ? should we ignore it ? again , as a grad of colin campbell ’ s program with cornell , i am definitely not lining up on the reductionist side of the fence . however , i wonder if we sometimes need to be realistic about the fact that compromised foods and compromised bodies often result in less than ideal assimilation of nutrients.if somebody is eating a complete wfpb diet and still presents with nutrient deficiencies , then this is a definite medical condition and should be treated as such , including therapeutic intake of concentrated nutrients . but this is treatment for a specific condition , not a general admonition for everybody . in addition , the person ’ s doctor should be trying to determine why with adequate dietary levels , they are still deficient . if that can be found and addressed , perhaps the person could stop supplement therapy and just go back to diet alone . somebody who has adequate nutrient balance from diet alone does not need take even more nutrients in concentrated form.i made this point once with jeff novick on one of his fb posting . i wasn ’ t de-friended but i was no longer allowed to post . i did not make the point in the form of a statement , but rather in the form of a question . no further commentary allowed . i thought it was not the best way to have an engaging conversation surrounding a topic with many differing opinions . allow the contrary opinion to remain and engage the counter argument . jhm : your points are strong and valid ! thanks for this post . @ clint stevens , fortunately this forum seems a bit more progressive ; there are numerous comments from people suggesting supplementation should be considered when needed . cheers ! i ’ m trying to be a vegan but people around me always say plants are just as “ bad ” because they contain pesticides and all . can anyone please tell me how to eat fruits / veggies safely ? what would happen if i eat those “ pesticides ” ? so right now i ’ m thinking : meat : cause cancer more rapidly , contains substances that somehow don ’ t “ fit ” in us . plants : pesticides and viruses . any advice please ? many thanks ! it is always a good idea to avoid persistent organic pollutants but the “ devil is in the details ” and it is a matter of context . the leading sources are diary , meat and fish see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / food-sources-of-perfluorochemicals / and … . http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / avoiding-other-banned-pesticides / . of course other non pesticide contaminants need to be worried about such cadmium , lead and arsenic … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods / . leading source of arsenic intake is chicken … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-many-cancers-have-been-caused-by-arsenic-laced-chicken / . sometimes these chemicals come from surprising sources see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-sodium-benzoate-harmful / . it is very complicated but clearly eating fruits , veggies , starches and legumes exposes us to less chemicals which can harm us . you can find many other video ’ s and studies to show how to minimize your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals . as far as viruses we aren ’ t susceptible to plant viruses but we can get exposure to bacteria and viruses for more on this subject you might want to view some of the 14 videos relating to “ viral infection ” … . the most recent is http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / infectobesity-adenovirus-36-and-childhood-obesity / . so refer those “ people around you ” to nutritionfacts.org to explore the relative dangers of fruits / veggies to dairy , meats and fish . good luck on your journey to eat healthier and stay tuned to nutritionfacts.org for the latest science and to reinforce your efforts to eat healthier.thank you : d. now i can assure myself to be a vegan ! you want to make sure to buy organic for anything without a peel . there are a ton of lists if you do a google search about which foods are most important to get organic and others you could skimp on if you are concerned about cost . ( i do a lot of smoothies with organic berries and spinach because they are cheaper frozen and generally just as nutritious . i mean , who can afford organic blueberries ? ! ) . berries , anything soy , leafy greens , apples , etc. you def want to get organic , whereas foods like avocado , bananas , pineapple , are less important because of their skin . i ’ ve used crop shares to save money on fruits and veggies . check out some of these : http : / / www.eatingwell.com / food _ news _ origins / organic _ natural / dirty _ dozen _ plus _ 14 _ foods _ you _ should _ buy _ organic , http : / / www.ewg.org / foodnews / summary.php. bear in mind that you are getting far more toxins eating meat , dairy , and fish.thank you very much ! anyway i always wonder why people around me eat cheap “ crap ” and then pay so much for medical expenses ! yeni : dr. forrester ’ s response was really excellent and to the point . the fact is , if someone is worried about pesticides and other contaminants , they would do well to get rid of the meat / fish , dairy and eggs.i ’ ll just add one tiny bit more info to help put the topic into perspective : what happens if you eat plants that are not organic ? is that really bad ? here ’ s a quote from one on dr. greger ’ s blog posts : “ a new study calculated that if half the u.s. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables , 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented . at the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases . so by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk , but that ’ s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption . even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks . ” from : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 06 / 25 / apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes / hope that helps.thanks for the link.hope more people will know this : di have read that with vitamins it ’ s all about getting a good brand , because it make a huge difference where things are sourced from and how the minerals are extracted . thoughts ? how do you know your vitamins are working ? ? i was taking $ 232 per mo. for 2.5 yrs with little effect. switched to this brand that offers $ back if they aren ’ t absorbing ! https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = om5-gpecl _ ai take a daily multivitamin only for the reason that i feel that it is an inexpensive way i can get the trace and rare earth minerals that are lacking in most farm-factory grown foods.all true … vitamin supplements probably do not do much ( if anything ) to protect against heart disease , diabetes and the like . but that should not surprise anyone – because most chronic diseases are not caused by vitamin deficiencies.but , vitamins do help in a myriad of other ways that are difficult to quantify.for myself , i eat a healthy whole food plant based diet . but when i tracked the micro nutrients from what i was eating on an iphone app , i found that my intake was deficient in several vitamins and minerals . and then , when my physician tested my blood for one of them ( vitamin d ) i found that i was actually slightly deficient in it.so , even though i eat a supposedly very healthy diet , i find that i need to take a multivitaminhow does being slight deficient in one vitamin mean that taking a multi vitamin is the answer ? also vitamin d is unique in that ’ s our body makes it from sunshine and cholesterol . given frequent short exposure to adequate uv light over a good percentage of your body , your body makes all the vitamin d it requires . food , animal or plant , has almost no vitamin d. if the label shows that a food has vitamin d , it is because a vitamin d pill was basically ground up and added . most americans live where we risk frostbite if we tried getting sun during the winter even if the uv level were adequate , which it is not . so supplementation of vitamin d is just the price we must pay for living clothed indoors at high latitudes rather than naked in the sun near the equator.there was one confirmed by blood test . there were several more where my intake was significantly below the rda but since there has been no blood test i can only assume that i have acdefiviencyand , by the way , my vitamin d was tested in the summer time and , despite the fact that i spent hours each day in the sun without sunscreen , it was still deficient.hmm , i thought we were supposed to be taking omega 3 as well ( especially vegans ) because it ’ s difficult to get enough out of flax or walnuts , etc. every day . right now i take vitamin d ( because i had it tested and it was low and i live in the north ) and omega 3 every other day or so.b12 is super important . adults needs roughly 2.4 micrograms per day . in supplement form it comes in higher doses . cheapest source of b12.for more on dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations . you are right dr. greger has mentioned taking some . see if that helps ? best , josephi ’ m sure sorry that there is a scientific consensus that vitamins are a waste of money . maybe people aren ’ t taking enough.dr. abram hoffer was treating people with orthomolecular therapy for over 50 years before his death in 2009 . he gave thousands of people ( both cancer and schizophrenia ) hope and his work lives on with biochemists like william j. walsh who wrote “ nutrient power : heal your biochemistry and heal your brain ” vitamin therapy is an alternative therapy now , like dietary intervention is . the two have a lot of power and might have power together.in an interview with abram hofferjournal of orthomolecular medicineofficial journal of the international society for orthomolecular medicine volume 24 3rd & 4th quarter 2009 a. saul , ph.d. page 122 “ “ how dangerous is niacin therapy ? ” i answer them , “ you are going to live a lot longer . is that a problem for you ? … i personally have been on 1,500 to 6,000 mg daily since 1955 . the biggest danger of taking niacin is that you live longer . one of my patients is 112 . she does cross country skiing and has been on niacin for 42 years . ” ( saul , 124 ) he lived to be over 90 and personally made this observation among his thousands of patients , to say nothing of those he treated and heard about with formerly mainstream niacin for heart disease.http : / / www.orthomolecular.org / library / jom / 2009 / pdf / 2009-v24n0304-p122.pdfwhat a great article . thank you , matthew . these were of particular interest.saul : “ yet it turns out that most of the negative reports are based on research that used ineffectively low doses of vitamins . ” hoffer : “ i agree . i could also spend millions to prove that the small amounts of these nutrients will not prevent car accidents . who is funding all these silly studies ? no orthomolecular physician ever claimed that giving 200 iu of vitamin e and 500 mg of c cured anything . perhaps you should write a paper with tongue in cheek in which you announce , “ antibiotics do not cure infection ” . then , report somewhere hidden in the paper that you only gave them 200 or even 20,000 iu of a drug that requires doses of one million or more . ” saul : “ vitamins have also been attacked with allegations that they are somehow actually dangerous . ” hoffer : “ i am really impressed with the concern some scientists share over those “ dangerous ” vitamins . i wish they were as worried over those dangerous poisons called drugs . each bottle of pills should have a poison label with skull and crossbones , and the word “ poison ” in large letters . ” thank you for reading the article so carefully ! some antibiotics can be under prescribed and it is strange that anti-depressants are now meant to carry a black box label for depression for teenagers . i am so happy to hear that every doctor except for one who saw dr. hoffer ’ s practice decided to use orthomolecular medicine in their profession . orthomolecular medicine has been discredited on the grounds that people who take niacin and get better are told retrospectively that they just have pellagra . dr. hoffra is one of the greatest doctors in the world for curing so many people with pellagra , then . wouldn ’ t it be great if heart disease was just pellagra ? all the symptoms can be treated with high doses of niacin , as has been done before statins . perhaps long term heart disease patients should stick to it , he said that they live longer. http : / / www.orthomolecular.org / library / jom / 1989 / pdf / 1989-v04n04-p211.pdf i am glad dr. hoffer caught so many cases of pellagra and has been able to cure it in several different illnesses . people who stay on niacin might take more of their statins , hearing that they could have pellagra and heart disease . dr. hoffer maybe had treated a lot of people who had pellagra and mental illnesses . if the disease responds to one gram of niacin a day , at least you ’ ll know it ’ s just pellagra.thank you for another good read . that article on niacin is very much appreciated . i believe a wfpb diet and healthy lifestyle can help the body heal . but if one has really abused the body in the younger years i think there are nutrients needed to repair the damage that one isn ’ t going to get just in healthy food . pellagra , hmmmm. lol.regarding getting all multivitamins through fruits and vegetables – i ’ ve heard over and over that fruit is not to be eaten within 30-60 minutes of eating vegetables . in some nf videos on antioxidants it is recommend to take berries with meals . does that mean fruit can be eaten together with vegetables ? i liked the article because it was simple and concise . i look forward to the day when you ’ ll be able to do a blood test using your smart phone . then you ’ ll know exactly what nutrients you need – hourly.i agree eric . and many vegans have marginal intakes of iodine , selenium , iron ( women ) and zinc ( men ) , so have a small amount of these in a multi is probably a good idea.and since when were multivitamins supposed to protect against cardiovascular disease ? they help protect against nutrient deficiencies ! multivitamins will be cost effective if there are deficiencies of those vitamins . if there are no defiencies of the vitamins , they are a waste of money , and may even be harmful . there are various studies showing this , even though it is
41	understanding lifestyle medicine from the heart i talk a lot about numbers and statistics , but as the director of yale ’ s prevention research center dr. david katz put it in an editorial in the american journal of health promotion , to reach doctors , our fellow colleagues , maybe we need to “ put a human face on it all . ” we have known , for at least a decade that the “ leading causes of both premature death and persistent misery in our society are chronic diseases that are , in turn , attributable to the use of our feet ( exercise ) , forks ( diet ) , and fingers ( cigarette smoking ) . feet , forks , and fingers are the master levels of medical destiny for not just thousands of people on any one occasion but the medical destiny of millions upon millions year after year . ” we as doctors , as a medical profession have known — ornish published his landmark study 25 years ago ( see our number one killer can be stopped ) . “ we have known , but we have not managed to care , ” writes dr. katz . “ at least not care deeply enough to turn what we know into what we routinely do . ” were we to do so , we might be able to eliminate most heart disease , strokes , diabetes , and cancer . but saving millions of lives is just a number . he asks doctors to : “ forget the bland statistics of public health , and ask yourself if you love someone who has suffered a heart attack , stroke , cancer , or diabetes … .now imagine their faces , whisper their names . recall what it felt like to get the news . and while at it , imagine the faces of others like you and me imagining beloved faces . now imagine if eight out of ten of us wistfully reflecting on intimate love and loss , on personal anguish , never got that dreadful news because it never happened . mom did not get cancer ; dad did not have a heart attack ; grandpa did not have a stroke ; sister , brother , aunt , and uncle did not lose a limb or kidney or eyes to diabetes . we are all intimately linked , in a network of personal tragedy that need never have occurred . ” which leads to what he is asking doctors to do about it : put a face on public health every chance you get . “ when talking about heart disease and its prevention — or cancer or diabetes — ask your audience to see in their mind ’ s eye the face of a loved one affected by that condition . then imagine that loved one among the 80 % who need never have succumbed if what we knew as doctors were what we do . ” “ invoke the mind ’ s eye , ” he advises , and “ then bring a tear to it . ” ( see convincing doctors to embrace lifestyle medicine ) . i think i ’ ve only profiled one other editorial ( ornish ’ s convergence of evidence ) , but this one really struck me , so much so i used it to close out my live presentation , more than an apple a day : combating common diseases . why don ’ t more doctors practice lifestyle medicine ? two theories are offered in the tomato effect and lifestyle medicine : treating the causes of disease . for more on the power of our day-to-day choices , see : i feel this way of educating people will get more people to listen because they want to take action . i ’ m no doctor , but i wish i could spread awareness easier without coming off as preachy . i also i like the photos you pick.it is hard to advocate for change in others . i mostly get away with it as a physician when patients or others open the door with questions about disease or disability . you can lead by example … a good form of teaching . another thought is to direct others to this website or other commercial free websites such as physicians committee for responsible medicine or dr. john mcdougall.dr. forrester , thank you for your feedback ! i have shied away from directing others to the hard facts ( in thought they might not read anything ) but i think it ’ ll be super beneficial to share with them , these two sites.thanks dr greger for sharing this so useful idea : put a face on a problem , so it triggers the emotion that has a chance to lead to action ! beliefs and habits are so hard to change . we need a good strategy to lead our patients to change instead of resistance.although this idea is excellent , i ’ ve frequently wanted to write to remind you that there are many of us , myself included , who despite being a vegetarian for most of my 53 years , exercising regularly , never smoke or drank alcohol or used drugs , still have been diagnosed with cancer multiple times . my belief is that we must look more closely at the environment and how all of our collective actions to harm it only harms ourselves . “ no man is an island , entire of itself ” . nutrition is one small piece of the health puzzle.sylvia , when you say you have been a vegetarian for most of your life does that mean you eat some animal protein ? none , no dairy , no animal products at all . i ate animal products as a child because i had no choice.hi sylvia , cancer does seem to be a ‘ great mystery ’ . my therory on it is that people with a ‘ higher metabolic rate ’ tend to be less prone to promoting cancer cell growth . my observation is younger people on ‘ junk-food diets ’ can be less suseptible , and older people on ‘ healthy diets ’ can have problems even though they may appear to be doing everything right.a high vo2max and a very low fitness age , coupled with a 100 % ‘ live ’ plant = based-diet ( no processed vegan food ) as a solution is just my therory that i am testing on myself . time will tell.http : / / www.ntnu.edu / cerg / vo2maxyou can eat a vegan diet without eating a healthy diet . i am not saying you eat a unhealthy diet . if not doing so already try a starch based diet with fruits and veggies and just a few nuts and seeds . and if you use any added oils use them very sparingly.i believe you are right about cancer and environmental factors . there are certain areas of the world that are more cancer prone than others . there are so many known carcinogens that are allowed in our food , water , air , soil , etc . synthetic everything.sylvia , it is a good thing that you have had cancer multiple times and are still with us . i hope your cancer stays under control or in remission and that you stay healthy . can you tell us more about your diet like what you eat on weekends ? would you consider your diet to be a high fat / low carb or a high carb / low fat ? do you eat much refined grains , sweet drinks or sodas , processed foods ? this is very interesting to me as i also walk your road . what would you be willing to share on your cancers and their treatments while being a vegetarian ? any info would be appreciated without getting too detailed.i ’ m not sure nutrition is a small piece of the puzzle . i would agree we are exposed to many carcinogens . you might enjoy watching dr. greger ’ s 2009 presentation … http : / / www.turnx.info / stopping _ cancer _ before _ it _ starts _ flash / it gives a good overview of cancer and the way we can minimize our risk for getting cancer or at least slowing it down so it isn ’ t clinically significant in our life time . sorry to read about multiple diagnoses of ca . good luck.i ’ m with janessa . when i told my wife and kids that i wasn ’ t bringing processed foods into the house anymore , they just rolled their eyes . when i told them i wasn ’ t bringing milk or juice home , my kids stopped talking to me for a week . my oldest is morbidly obese and will binge on candy , cookies and ice cream while lamenting her weight problem . my wife tries to lose weight with low carb even though she says that her heart health scares her and she knows it ’ s not good for her . i cook healthy dinners and they make something else ( or go out to eat ) .how do i convey to them the seriousness of their decisions ? how do i convert them to a healthy lifestyle ? my wife ’ s sister died of breast cancer 3 years ago at age 40 … how much of a wake-up call do people need ? ? enthusiast : you are in a difficult position because your wife is not on board . i don ’ t know if this will help or not , but here is a recorded audio interview between chef aj and a woman who at one point brought her family “ over ” , including three children who were * very * not happy at first . you have a different situation , but maybe you can get some ideas from this talk ? ? ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = s4bxpzio9na & feature = youtu.bewould showing forks over knives to your family help ? ? ? my heart goes out to you . i hope you are able to make some progress.thanks , i ’ ll watch that . not sure i could get them to sit thru fok ; ) i know it ’ s no help at all , but your problem is universal , and how we got into this situation in the first place . i know because i was “ one of them ” . for me it took a diabetes diagnosis to wake me up , sad but true , and still i know others who just take their meds and go on as always , making no changes , losing limbs and life . why ? what is the trigger to make that connection ? sure wish i knew ! i really think that if doctors like our beloved dr g started presenting a stronger case for nutrition and emphasized that pills are temporary measures to help , not fix the problems . almost everyone i know panders to their tastebuds with hardly a thought of the consequences , besides fleeting guilt sometimes . it ’ s a problem with so many layers ! i think with all the different ideas about diet , people just tune out to all of it because it gets so confusing ! if somehow we could present the truth in a united and universal way , and stop all the stupid conflict , it would help greatly ! i vote we make dr greger president , and let him take care of it ! lol ! ! ! hello . there is a discussion about diabetes at this link at this site : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / amla-versus-diabetes / this site makes some recommendations for diabetes : hibiscus tea , cinnamon ( one teaspoon a day of the “ toxic ” variety can bring blood sugar to normal ) , flax seed meal , amla , and beans are recommended here for high blood sugar.thule has produced another list of recommendations from this site : indian gooseberries ( amla ) , .coffee , soy , flaxseeds , green tea , pulses ( dried beans ) , chamomile tea , purple potatoes , sprouts , whole grains , vinegar , and beans.some of these food can work as well as the leading prescription without the side effects.unfortunately the main reason doctors treat chronic diseases instead of prevent them is the same reason willie sutton robbed banks , because that ’ s where the money is . we do not have a health care system but instead have a disease management system that creates more sickness than it treats . drugs are given which create side effects which are treated with still more drugs which create still more side effects in an endless loop . as dr. greger and others have pointed out , disease can be both prevented and treated with food , but that is not profitable for doctors , hospitals , drug companies , etc and the entire medical-pharmaceutical complex . what we really need is a dramatic change in the way medical schools and our medical system operate , that is , for people and not for profits . and unfortunately that would put many doctors out of business.well summed up . in other words , the ‘ system ’ is broken . or perhaps more to the point , the people are broken.with all due respect , this notion that the medical establishment has an underlying , ulterior motive to perpetuate illness in order to profit is ridiculous . i have been a physician for 25 years and i assure you there is absolutely no need to drum up business . sunday night i drove home four hours in a torrential downpour after seeing dr. greger in person in camarillo , ca . ( it was a thrill ) . the following day i was on call and accepted 21 patients to our 56 bed psych hospital , with another 10 waiting in the er for their turn . of the five new patients that i personally admitted , one was a pleasant , 187 lb . 55 y / o lady on 24 different medications for problems ranging from diabetes to hypertension to hyperlipidemia to coagulopathy , etc . as i reviewed with her her list of meds she knew exactly what each one was for and was adamant they all be continued . strict adherence to an ornish-style diet would probably eventually allow her to discontinue 90 % of them . however , she had been clean and sober for 13 years and as far as she was concerned that was as much lifestyle sacrifice as she was willing to accept . there is no “ big medicine ” conspiracy to keep healthy life choices a secret . is there an american alive who doesn ’ t know what the term “ junk food ” means ? yet millions choose to consume it every day . who doesn ’ t understand that sugar makes you fat and smoking causes cancer ? psych md , i agree with you that way too many eat junk food . that does not mean that much of the medical system aims for money rather than health . why would they send people to jail who don ’ t use chemo and radiation when chemo is horribly expensive and 3 % expensive ? just because many eat junk food doesn ’ t rule out ill will among the greedy . i think it ’ s mostly not doctors but salesmen and corporate types . john s pdx ori ’ m having trouble understanding your sentence re : sending people to jail for not using chemo . my specialty is not particularly lucrative compared to most others , but i have never found it necessary , nor has the thought ever occurred to me to render suboptimal care to insure a continuous stream of business . we have patients literally lined up at the door waiting to get in . years ago i knew an internist who would not accept smokers into his practice . as a result he had fewer but healthier patients . greed obviously exists but i believe that the vast majority of physicians have their patients ’ best interests in mind . for a substantial portion of our society instant gratification is a primary driving force which , unfortunately , often leads to delayed deleterious outcomes.issues regarding consent issues with minors with respect to chemotherapy ( e.g. the case in connecticut ) are very much outliers . minors are the only population [ aside from those judged incompetent by a court of law , involved in the criminal justice system , or unconscious ( e.g. coma ) ] that a court can either compel or restrict medical treatment . that is a red herringthere are obviously many factors that go into how broken our medical industry is in the us . i do think that physicians are contributing significantly to the problem . i think most of us aren ’ t aware of how we contribute to the problem . i speak to physicians regularly about chronic conditions and lifestyle interventions , over treatment and over testing . they are generally appreciative of the information . unfortunately there is alot of momentum in the systems we work in to support the status quo . i think each physician needs to work in their own specialty to avoid over treatment and over diagnosis as well as reinforce their colleagues working in other specialties . they need to keep up with the most current science . currently i ’ m going through the experience of studying to take my family medicine boards for the sixth time . the only disadvantage i have is that the “ correct ” answers in lifestyle medicine has not caught up to the boards yet . no mention of the nordic cochrane collaboration report on the problems with routine mammogram screening for populations as opposed to indicated diagnostic mammography . no mention of the value of diet and exercise to prevent , stabilize and often cure chronic conditions . no mention of the long term adverse consequences to prescribing psychiatric medications … read robert whitaker ’ s anatomy of an epidemic or peter breggin ’ s psychiatric drug withdrawal : a guide for prescribers , therapists , patients and their families . it is important for us that work in treating diabetes , arterial disease and weight issues to give the correct information to our patients and their families . we know about advising to stop smoking to minimize the risks of developing cancer . we should know that the issue with sugar is that it has a calorie density of 1800 cal / pound and understand the physiology enough to explain to patients the difference between starches ( i.e .. calorie density 500 ) , breads ( i.e. 1400 ) and oils ( i.e. 4000 ) . physicians need to lead the way to better population health one patient at a time . it will take a team effort . we have too many patients on too many drugs and every drug prescription requires the signature of a health care provider . we need to begin to “ detox ” our patients off medications through skillful counseling and the foundation for that is the best science . i encourage all physicians to subscribe to nutrtionfacts.org to keep current so they can give patients the best information and also improve their own health.hear , hear , dr. don ! i really appreciate the point being made here , but the problem is that the issue is presented in a way that makes it sound as if almost no one would ever die if these lifestyle changes were made . people would still get cancer or some other disease eventually — just not as soon . it ’ s unhelpful and inaccurate to talk about eliminating most cancers and other lifestyle diseases , rather than increasing the number of good-quality years in people ’ s lives.i often want to share material from this site with friends , especially with regards to meat-eating , but whenever i do , this is the main criticism i get , and it leads to the core message being ignored , because the “ we can eliminate most cancer ! ” claim comes across as zealotry , and it ’ s inaccuracy obscures the scientific basis for the recommendations.how would you increase the number of good quality years in people ’ s lives if no change to the standard western diet was made ? if people ’ s bodies are “ breaking down ” / aging faster than they should due to a standard western diet for example , then the quality of life will be degraded earlier.that ’ s a tough one . one battle is making the public understand that “ healthspan ” is really the more relevant term rather than “ lifespan . ” another is that , although up until now there haven ’ t been * effective * pharmaceutical interventions against aging and / or age related diseases , there are emerging interventions such as basis by elysium ( that has 5 nobel prize winners on its board ) that have very promising results in rodent models ( their specific trick is high doses of pterostilbene and nicotinamide riboside ) . basis is currently being marketed as a supplement , but their board and ceo want to start human trials very soon ( at least , that ’ s their publicly stated intent ) .while i ’ m not convinced enough to drop $ 50 / month on that product , i do eat various types of wild berries ( e.g. wild ( low-bush ) blueberries and various others ) that have among the highest concentrations of pterostilbene available in natural fruits ( ug vs 10 ^ 5 more in basis ) that are just as , if not more , expensive to procure . i ’ m not convinced yet that nicotinamide riboside is the panacea they ’ re claiming it is . mouse models have shown that it ’ s effective at preventing hearing loss ( and / or regenerating hair cells ) when administered into the middle ear ( and / or systemically available for uptake into the blood supply for the cochlea ) . but the argument that it supplements nad + has not yet been borne out , even in rodent models , and even then there are no standards or baseline on what nad + deficiency is , how to measure it , or whether systemic administration will increase mitochondrial uptake.the only supplement backed by significant , real science that has demonstrated uptake by mitochondria is mitoq . even then , i ’ m skeptical that it provides the long-term benefits in humans . they are doing longitudinal studies , but that takes years.at best , regarding health and longevity .. diet is 50 % of the equation.what every centurian has in common … is a large degree of daily ( rural ) physical activity ( okinawan ’ s in the 50 ’ s & 60 ’ s ) . something that can not be achieved in the usa without … janess hits a key word “ preachy ” . in the medical field , we come across as having all the information , “ listen to me , i can help you . ” patients should feel comfortable looking at us and saying “ listen to me , this is my problem and this is what i need for you to help me . ” our current stimulus for action is the experience of pain . to successfully grow lifestyle changes , make patients warriors in the battle instead of making them church members in the pew.i ’ ve been vegan for about one year . certainly a sacrifice but there is a lot of good food to eat . the one food i don ’ t eat now but consider eating is nuts . after having 2 stents i went vegan soon after i read dr esselstyn book “ preventing and reversing heart disease ” . in the book he does not endorse nuts yet i see a lot of positive research about eating nuts . i think the rational around dr esselstyn ’ s advice is to try to avoid the high fat found in nuts . so i guess the question in a nutshell , should i eat nuts ?

42	don 't forget fiber the famous surgeon denis burkitt is better known for his discovery of a childhood cancer now known as burkitt ’ s lymphoma than for his 1979 international bestseller , don ’ t forget the fibre in your diet . anyone asked to list the twenty or more most important advances in health made in the last few decades would be likely to include none of what dr. burkitt considered to be among the most significant . what was the number one most important advance in health according to one of the most famous medical figures of the 20th century ? the discovery that “ many of the major and commonest diseases in modern western culture are universally rare in third-world communities , were uncommon even in the united states until after world war l ” yet are now common in anyone following the western lifestyle . so it ’ s not genetics — they ’ re lifestyle diseases ( see dr. burkitt ’ s f-word diet ) . this means they must potentially be preventable . those eating the standard american diet have very high levels of a long list of diseases — such as heart disease and colon cancer — that were similar to the rates of disease in the ruling white class in apartheid africa . conversely , the rates in the bantu population were very low . these native africans ate the same three sister diets of many native americans , a plant-based diet centered around corn , beans , and squash . in fact , it was reported that cancer was so seldom seen in american indians a century ago they were considered practically immune to cancer — and heart disease . what are “ very low ” rates ? 1300 bantus were autopsied over five years in a bantu hospital and less than ten cases of ischemic heart disease , the west ’ s number one killer . the bantu ’ s rates of heart and intestinal disease is similar to poor indians , whereas wealthier indians who ate more animal and refined foods were closer to those in japan — unless they moved to the u.s. and started living like us . you find similar trends for the other so-called western diseases , which burkitt thought were related to the major dietary changes that followed the lndustrial revolution : a reduction in healthy whole plant foods — the source of starch and fiber – and a great increase in consumption of animal fats , salt , and sugar . his theory was that it was the fiber . he believed all of these major diseases may be caused by a diet deficient in whole plant foods , the only natural source of fiber . fiber ? in a survey of 2,000 americans , over 95 % of graduate school-educated participants and health care providers weren ’ t even aware of the daily recommended fiber intake . doctors don ’ t even know . how much fiber should we shoot for ? the institute of medicine recommends 38 grams for men 50 years and younger and 30 grams for men over 50 years . women 50 years and younger should get 25 and those older than 50 should get 21 grams . but these levels are just the minimum . i recommend we look to our evolutionary past for more clues on fiber intake . see my video paleolithic lessons . one analogy dr. burkitt used is this : “ if a floor is flooded as a result of a dripping tap , it is of little use to mop up the floor unless the tap is turned off . the water from the tap represents the cause of disease , the flooded floor the diseases filling our hospital beds . medical students learn far more about methods of floor mopping than about turning off taps , and doctors who are specialists in mops and brushes can earn infinitely more than those dedicated to shutting off taps . ” and the drug companies are more than happy to sell us rolls of paper towels , so patients can buy a new roll every day for the rest of their lives . to paraphrase ogden nash : modern medicine is making great progress , but just headed in the wrong direction . how do we know that diet was the critical factor ? because when we place people stricken with these diseases on plant-based diets , their disease can be reversed ( our number one killer can be stopped ) . in fact it was the work of burkitt and others in africa that led to the disease reversal work of pioneers like nathan pritikin ( engineering a cure ) . more on fiber : and for more of the scoop on poop : burkitt died of a stroke apparently at 82 . was he not following his own advice ? ? matt – there is some irony there , huh ? in addition to his etiology of pediatric cancer , dr. burkitt discovered early on the connection between low fiber intake and the western diet and diseases such as heart disease and diabetes . he was also an early influencer of dr. john mcdougall , a thought leader and pioneer in promoting health and wellness through a low fat , whole food , plant based diet . check out this video for more info on diet and disease. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death / i have a lot of respect for mcdougall ’ s take on whole foods , but especially his pet … “ starches ” , he totally saved my sanity and helped me drop 50 % of 300 obese pounds ! though i personally can ’ t do the 75 % he recommends , more like 60 % , my lifelong “ fear ” of all starches ( carbs ) indiscriminately , was misplaced , unhealthy , and greatly contributed to my problems ! ( of course he recommends complex starches such as grains , legumes , tubers , starchy veggies and the like , and not processed starches as in white flour and bakery goods ! ) history can be a valuable teacher ! kudos to you charzie , for dropping 50 % . every bit helps and it sounds like what you are doing is working for you . you are a great success storyor you could look at it another way : we all have to die of something ( the mortality rate of the human race is 100 % ! ) better to die at 82 suddenly of a stroke than to die slowly of a heart attack at 56 and spend the next 20 years dying . 82 isn ’ t a bad life span ! plus , a big percentage of strokes are caused by stress . and we all know what the mainstream medical profession does to those professionals who do not subscribe to their theories . just a thought.we need be careful when assessing the flaws in others due to what we expect their health should have been . i don ’ t know burkitt ’ s total lifestyle . for example , was he carnivorous , exercise regularly , have a healthy outlook on life , handle stress well , etc ? . eating fiber is only one part of the whole story , and i appreciate his input in an area of health that needs a lot of attention.how many 10 year vegans do you think were around in the uk or even us in 1993 ( his death year ) . without looking it up 82 is about the median expectancy today whether healthy or not . maybe with a quicker medical response they could have saved him and got him into the nursing home for the typical last 10 year torture . i was shocked to learn that on average there is not much difference in life expectancy of vegan vs nonvegan but the difference is in quality of life as you age especially if you end up strong enough to survive the last 10 or more years in poor physical or mental health.maybe the doc should expand on the role of starch as it has a bad reputation among the general population as well as carbohydrates . i have enough information to counteract the misconceptions about carbs but not about starch.people consume a lot of fat with the starchy foods , that ’ s where the confusion comes from.carbophobes and the paleophile crowd fear carbs , of which starch is a type . specifically , starch is a polysaccharide . starch is a large molecule made of many ( poly ) glucose molecules . it ’ s how plants store energy . so , the info you have about carbs , would almost always apply to starch.http : / / www.medicalnewstoday.com / articles / 161547.phphttp : / / www.chemistryexplained.com / st-te / starch.htmlread “ the starch solution ” by dr. john mcdougall. http : / / www.drmcdougall.comdr. mcdougall ’ s book is an excellent source . his website has a number of free electures under education > videos including his presentation , the starch solution . the book is about half recipes courtesy of the other half of the mcdougall team … his wife mary . once you understand the importance of what to eat you need to change your behavior by shopping and cooking and eating differently . there is so much misinformation out there it is important to have accurate commercial free sources of information … for me the big three are nutritionfacts.org , drmcdougall.com and pcrm.org. there are others out there as well such as vegsource.com. our beliefs help us navigate our complex world . if we believe that a food is healthy then we tend to buy it . if we believe a food is harmful , addictive and contains poisons we tend to avoid . so it is a natural tendency for people to grab onto a concept like the mediterranean diet and run with it … even if the devil is in the details . having an understanding of statistics helps but isn ’ t necessary if you find trustworthy sources . one problem is we don ’ t know what we are doing is harmful is until it is too late or we get into a disease state we could have avoided . the other is that do to variation in populations you can do everything right and still have a heart attack or stroke . i think for me it is about “ stacking the odds in our favor ” so that we delay death , avoid disability , minimize drugs / procedures and lead quality lives . i like to tell my patients it is about 80 % nutrition and 20 % fitness . here again the devil is in the details . exercising doesn ’ t necessarily equate to being fit . i heard dr. alec isabeau of true north health give a nice presentation that equated fitness to aerobic , strength , flexibility , balance and stability . so i recommend as a minimum folks subscribe to nutritionfacts.org and the mcdougall newsletter and beyond that explore topics of personal interest . the science keeps changing and no doubt we will know more in 5 to 10 years then we did 5 to 10 years ago … so keep tuned to nutritionfacts.org.i remember maybe twenty or so years ago fiber became a hot advertising topic so , of course , the cereal and bread companies were all trying to “ out-fiber ” each other . the winner of the fiber race was a bread called , i think , new horizon . sales soared until their secret ingredient was revealed . to increase the fiber content they were adding sawdust.wow. just wow.i do remember that ! so was that sawdust “ bad ” fiber , or was it just the idea of sawdust that made it lose it ’ s appeal ? oh hell no ! you have a link for that ? reminds me of some the stuff i read in this book : http : / / www.amazon.com / salt-sugar-fat-giants-hooked / dp / 0812982193something jumps out at me after reading this . as a whole , our society seems to search for the answers to problems in specifics … cholesterol , fiber , saturated fat , certain vitamins , antioxidants , etc . of course we know this is all critical and valuable information , or we wouldn ’ t be here ! but the general population seems to have a tendency to take any of this information and bastardize it into some kind of twisted human shortcut . using this article as an example , they will run to the store and grab a fiber supplement to add to their milkshake that they gulp in addition to their usual sad , and think they are doing a healthy thing ! it never occurs to them that eating the foods rich in fiber is a huge part of the benefit too ! same with gulping handfuls of vitamins and supplements , or cutting out red meat in favor of fish and / or poultry , and so on ! i was once there myself , and drove myself crazy because i knew instinctively it was all wrong . our lives can get so complicated we forget who we really are and where we come from … the good earth , and we pay dearly . when i hit the proverbial wall , it was a health crisis . suddenly i was forced into a position to rethink everything … or perish ! amazing motivation ! it sucks , but it was my redemption . in the midst of chaos came clarity … i had to simplify my life and get back to nature , via the 60 ’ s hippie child who still resided within somewhere ! the only analogy i can think of to describe the way it felt , is to imagine a caterpillar emerging from it ’ s cocoon as a butterfly ! i felt ( and eventually looked ) like a whole different creature , and was able to shed the excess parts that were no longer useful for ones that brought balance and freedom . ( kind of flowery i know , but hey … butterfly ! lol ) my whole point here is , if we just learn to eat wholesome , unprocessed plant food , as it comes from nature , ( and even try cultivating or foraging some too ! ) we would all be a whole lot better off as a nation than debating the merits of the various contributing factors complicating health issues ! ( that doesn ’ t necessarily apply here , of course ! lol ) best of health to all of you ! ! ! you are absolutely right about the unfortunate ( and all too human ) tendency to want to simplify a message and take a short-cut whenever possible . and , of course , a fiber supplement does not have nearly the same benefits as a high fiber , plant-based diet . one of the videos linked above , prunes vs. metamucil vs. vegan diet provides a nice illustration of your point . the nutrient alone ( metamucil ) is not as good as the food ( prunes ) is not as good as the diet ( vegan ) . and this is just looking at constipation . think of all the other health benefits of a diet rich in fiber ! on the other hand , a complex message is not always better . i found it interesting to see a recent study ( see here and here ) that compared weight loss in study participants who were instructed to eat 30 grams of fiber daily with those who were instructed to follow the american heart association guidelines and the “ high fiber ” group lost a similar amount of weight even from a single recommendation . even though , 30 grams of fiber is not a truly high fiber level ( more like a good minimum for most adults ) and there are certainly many other aspects to a healthy diet , that one change may have led to increased consumption of less processed plant-foods and still yielded some benefits.best of health to you too ! it ’ s true that the study of nutrition has tended to be reduced to which foods are the sources of which specific nutrients . dr. campbell calls this “ reductionism ” and discusses it in his book whole . this thinking has spawned the whole supplement industry and has led to simplistic thinking ( “ my doctor told me to eat a banana a day for potassium ! ” ) when i tell people i eat a whole food plant-based diet they usually express concern about , of course , protein and also that it ’ s just not a complete diet . au contraire ! i don ’ t believe that physicians or nutritionists are aware of all the elements in foods that are good for us and that are refined out of the sad . i don ’ t think that a person who eats the sad , even after adding in “ enriched ” foods and loads of supplements , can make up for the nutrients left out and the bad elements added in . yes , eat food as natural as possible to get more nutritional value.i have had the same epiphany after chasing the alternative health movement for 40 years . my attention has been jerked from one ‘ answer ’ to another for all of our ills . finally i ’ ve settled on an answer for myself ; whole , simple foods just the way god put them on this earth . i don ’ t think our creator meant for it to be rocket science . if vitamin c is the answer , eat more oranges and lemons . if calcium is the answer , eat more greens . if vitamin a is the answer then eat more carrots . in other words , when you eat whole healthy foods from the earth , you will automatically get everything you need from every category . nothing works in isolation but in synergy with everything else to provide a complete answer . my epiphany came with the introduction of green smoothies to my life . wow ! what a simplified answer . i start off every day with more raw fruits and vegetables than i used to get in a whole week ! and the health inprovements would take me another whole paragraph . acid reflux- gone , esophogeal spasms – gone , carpal tunnel – gone , 20 pounds – gone , 25 years of sleep problems – gone , extreme dry mouth – gone . i can ’ t imagine the amount of fiber they contain ! i have quit looking at my health in isolated elements and started thinking of it as a complete picture . and it is looking better all the time ! thanks dr. gregor ; i appreciate all your videos and articles . i saw a lecture of dr. burkitt on video on the subject of fiber , which was interesting and informative.i am not sure i understand fiber … hoping for some answers . if i put a cup of oats or a cup of buckwheat in my blendtec and turn them into flour – does the fiber disappear ? same question with regard to carrots … if i blend them with water in the blender – does the fiber go away ? thanks in advance for some clarity .. you are asking one of the best questions i ’ ve seen . i hope someone answers your query . i will give you a partial answer and i don ’ t know if anyone knows the full answer . fiber is something in the “ whole ” food . its not important in itself but as part of the whole food . it doesn ’ t go away but is transformed . a brick is different from powdered minerals . there are nutrients there but they are quickly getting oxidized or transformed also . the undigested , and partially whole fiber , is creating nooks for bacteria when it gets to the colon so it may do some helpful things . in some foods it may be protecting nutrients from changing , or getting absorbed , so some of the nutrients get into you and some are shared with the different bacteria and reactions that go on inside the bowel . some foods blended up may be just as good or better and some foods may be greatly degraded . i don ’ t think anyone has worked this all out to know the advantages and disadvantages for all the different foods . the different combination parameters are astronomical when we look into combining foods and how they could interact . don ’ t think about cooking , that ’ s another astronomical combination . we measure the nutrients we know but there are likely thousands of other things that are important we haven ’ t recognized yet most likely . no one knows but eating everything whole is best but not likely practical as we would have to spend the day chewing and eating . but is that for sure necessary ? or worthwhile . i would say , eat whole as much as you can but the others ways have good advantages too . if you eat 50 % whole that may be as good as 100 % . i don ’ t know and i ’ m not sure anyone else does either . good thinking and great question.thanks for your thoughts … someone told me that once i ground the grains into flour – they had no fiber . but i can ’ t reconcile that with cooking them until they are soft and then chewing them . why would that retain fiber if blending them before swallowing wouldn ’ t ? still confused.great question ! if all parts of the grain are kept in the flour , then you ’ ve still got the fiber . the fiber is found in the bran portion of the grain ( the other parts of the grain are the germ and the endosperm ) ; so if the bran remains in the flour , so does the fiber . this illustrates the difference between whole grain flours and refined flours . refined flours are made by removing the bran and the germ , removing much of the grains goodness ( like protein , fiber , vitamins and minerals ) . here ’ s a great page explaining the whole grain in its entirety : http : / / www.precisionnutrition.com / all-about-grainshi jackie . good question . if you filter the juice , you will lose phytonutrients . take a look at the nonextractable polyphenols , usually ignored , are the major part of dietary polyphenols . most polyphenol phytonutrients in plants are locked to the fiber . take a look at this video : [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber / ] to put it into perspective.i guess i would answer this way . chewing is not anywhere near as efficient as blending . the fiber is much smaller blended but perhaps that is still ok and perhaps not . blending leaves all the nutrients but they “ may ” start degrading and oxidizing sooner in a more “ open ” form . if you drink it right away , maybe not so much . cooking is not as efficient as blending but could destroy some nutrients but with some foods allow them to be released . also with whole grains ground into flour , the glycemic index is near the same as processed flour and that may have health detriments but its way better then refined flour that may not have some balancing compounds to blunt that.some of the fiber in its more intact “ structure ” ? ? could have advantages to the microbiome , that when not optimized , has been linked to immune disease , cancer and atherosclerosis . just “ google ” microbiome to see all the evolving research into that area.i blend greens and other foods all the time . it is way better to do that and what you describe then to buy it processed and the nutrient levels will be higher and the fiber perhaps “ bigger ” especially if you don ’ t blend too long.it may be that our “ system ” evolved to have the fiber pieces in our gut. including the way bacteria use them and the way they may distribute nutrients and compounds that change on the way through the digestive process . the size of those may matter more or less . i don ’ t “ know ” that . but … it certainly appears with heath outcome data from epidemiology and studies that eating whole plant based foods gives the best outcomes by far for health and all the human benefits that go from there . i guess … blend some of the food , not too long , and eat some things whole , can ’ t be bad. good to discuss with you . it helps me think for explanations to others that ask me in real life.jackie , fiber can be soluble ( e.g. , apple juice has fiber from the soluble pectin ) or insoluble . grinding prior to eating does not destroy the fiber . your teeth and stomach grind and break down foods the same way . fiber is not destroyed . fiber passes through our gut , and some of it is broken down by bacteria . dr. greger posted a video on that , i believe . check this site out : http : / / www.medicalnewstoday.com / articles / 146935.phpthanks to all for the information . appreciate your responses.no one knows how fiber effects the nutrient use and bacterial interactions in our gut and how we may have evolved to take advantage of that . components of fiber “ may ” not be the same as more intact fiber . it would appear healthful to take that into consideration with some of the diet “ whole ” to help accomadate that process.ok , i ’ m slowing becoming convinced of the importance of a plant-based diet . but in my over 20 years of searching for answers for health issues , i have come across some very important issues that i can ’ t quite fit with a fully plant based diet . i ’ d really appreciate it if dr greger could personally address these , or direct us all to past videos / articles of his that do address these . i ’ m sure all of dr greger ’ s audience would benefit from these answers . 1 ) how does one get enough iron on a plant-based diet ? 2 ) how does one get enough b12 on a plant-based diet ? 3 ) i have read dr kate rheume-bleue ’ s great book “ vitamin k2 : the calcium paradox ” . unless one eats natto ( not me ! ) , there is no significant way to get enough vitamin k2 ( we get it from the tissues of ruminants who produce it from k1 they get in the chorolphyll in the grass they eat ) . k2 , along with vitamin d and vitamin a ( real a , not beta carotene ) , regulate calcium and keep it in your teeth and bones and remove it from your arteries . so how do we humans , who do not have the ability to make k2 from k1 , get our k2 if we don ’ t eat animals who eat grass or animals who eat animals who eat grass ? as dr kate shows , the rise of heart disease correlates to when farmers started feeding their animals grains and stopped letting them eat what they should be eating – grasses . her book incorporates the world-wide health studies of indigenous populations who lack heart disease and other western diseases , done by dr weston price in the 20 ’ s and 30 ’ s . 4 ) i was fascinated to hear of dr greger ’ s video on saturated fat ’ s ability to prevent insulin from working with blood sugar . is it only animal-based saturated fat or all fats ? does coconut oil have this same effect on insulin ? do any other oils ( fish oil , krill oil , nuts , olive oil , etct ) have this effect ? 5 ) i was also fascinated to hear from dr greger that a study showed that eating animal meat causes insulin to be released ( not blood sugar , just insulin , right ? ) . i read that that study has not been duplicated . does he know anything about that ? and can dr greger explain why this happens ? what is the mechanism ? 6 ) with all the studies i hear about related to the health problems that seem to be associated with eating animal products , i always wonder – were the animals grass-fed and were the meats loaded with k2 or were they not grass-fed and devoid of it ( as most animal products are now ) ? i want to know if this issue has any bearing on why these studies show disease from a non-plant based diet.if we ’ re all looking for the truth about our health , these questions need answers . thank you ! i am just a lay person , but i will try to answer some of your questions . plenty of plant foods have iron . this non vegan site lists no animal foods as a good source of iron. http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = nutrient & dbid = 70 this might be the case , since whfoods.com does not list liver or red meat as one of the healthiest foods . this site , which lists all foods http : / / www.healthaliciousness.com / articles / food-sources-of-iron.php stated that mollusks , such as oysters , and clams as well as liver and red meat have good amounts of iron . eggs are not that high in iron http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / dairy-and-egg-products / 117 / 2 and milk has no iron http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / dairy-and-egg-products / 69 / 2 . chicken is not particularly high in iron , either http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / poultry-products / 671 / 2 the issue is that non heme iron in plants is not as well absorbed as heme iron found in red meat . however , the upside to this is that one cannot get an overdose of iron on plants , but a person can overdose from the heme iron found in red meat , liver or mollusks . eating vitamin c along with the iron source promotes its absorption . i don ’ t eat animal products , but my blood work showed my iron levels were sufficient . i do eat blackstrap molasses and pumpkin seeds most days as these are high in iron . as for “ real ” vitamin a , there are very few good animal sources of this . only liver is a good source and who would want to eat liver everyday ? you would have to eat two sticks of butter everyday or 16 eggs everyday to get enough vitamin a. and just like heme iron , “ real ” vitamin a is toxic in large amounts , whereas beta carotene is not . and there are lots of plants that have lots of beta carotene and even if it is not all converted , there is so much in these sources that plenty will be converted to retinol . this same site showed that sweet potatoes , among other plant foods , such as carrots and dark green vegetables , have far more retinol equivalents than any animal food except liver . pumpkin is also an excellent source. http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = nutrient & dbid = 106 of course , one absorbs the beta carotene better if one includes a whole plant food fat source , such as nuts , with the beta carotene source . i eat a carrot as well as turnip greens everyday for beta carotene . as for b12 and k2- both of these are made by bacteria , not made by animals . even mercola , who is a strong advocate of animal products , stated a person could get k2 from other fermented vegetables , such as sauerkraut . sauerkraut might be a bit more palatable than natto is . he stated here that using the right starter culture will raise the amount of k2 in the vegetables. http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2012 / 11 / 19 / fennel-plant-prevents-bone-loss.aspx since b12 is made by bacteria , i don ’ t see why a person couldn ’ t get b12 from vegetables fermented with the right starter culture as well . as for the inuit having no heart disease , that is a pure myth that has been disproven . here is loren cordain , a strong advocate of eating animals , who stated that archaeology showed that the inuit often had severe atherosclerosis long before they would have eaten any western foods. http : / / www.meandmydiabetes.com / 2010 / 03 / 24 / loren-cordain-caution-on-saturated-fats-disaster-with-grains-will-be-public-after-march-25th / daniel : how nice of you take the time to write all of this information out . and so well done to ! thanks.related to patrice ’ s question , what about taurine ?

46	why pepper boosts turmeric blood levels “ historians from all around the world have produced evidence to show that apparently all primitive peoples used herbs-often in a sophisticated way . quinine from cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of malaria long before the disease was identified , and the raw ingredients of a common aspirin tablet have been a popular painkiller for far longer than we have had access to tablet-making machinery . indeed , today many pharmacological classes of drugs include a natural product prototype that we originally discovered through the study of traditional cures and folk knowledge of indigenous people . ” there ’ s a plant in south asia called adhatoda ( from adu meaning “ goat , ” and thoda meaning “ not touch ” because it ’ s so bitter even the goats won ’ t eat it ) . it has compounds that help open one ’ s airways and as such , adhatoda tea has been used traditionally to treat asthma , where the leaves are steeped with black peppercorns . leaves steeped with black peppercorns ? that sounds gross to me — why would they do that ? because they ’ re smart . back in 1928 , scientists discovered what the people evidently already knew , that adding pepper increased the anti-asthmatic properties of the leaves . black pepper alone didn ’ t work : it was the combination . and now we know why . just like approximately 5 % of the spice turmeric is composed of an active compound called curcumin , about 5 % of black pepper by weight is comprised of this compound called piperine . curcumin is responsible for the yellow color of turmeric and piperine for the pungent flavor of pepper . piperine is a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism . one of the ways our liver gets rid of foreign substances is making them water soluble so they can be more easily excreted . but this black pepper molecule inhibits that process . and it doesn ’ t take much . if people are given a bunch of turmeric curcumin , within an hour there ’ s a little bump in the level in their blood stream . we don ’ t see a large increase because our liver is actively trying to get rid of it . but what if the process is suppressed by taking just a quarter teaspoon ’ s worth of black pepper ? then you see curcumin levels skyrocket ( see boosting the bioavailability of curcumin ) . the same amount of curcumin consumed , but the bioavailability shoots up 2000 % . even just a little pinch of pepper — 1 / 20th of a teaspoon — can significantly boost levels . and guess what a common ingredient in curry powder is besides turmeric ? black pepper . another way to boost the absorption of curcumin is to consume it in the whole food , turmeric root ( fresh or dried as a powder ) because natural oils found in turmeric root and turmeric powder can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin seven to eight fold . when eaten with fat , curcumin can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lymphatic system thereby in part bypassing the liver . how is it prepared in india ? with fat and black pepper . amazing how they could figure that out without double blind trials . ( though maybe it just tastes good , and it ’ s merely coincidence ? ) their traditional knowledge certainly failed them with ghee , however , which is practically pure butter fat , which may explain india ’ s relatively high rates of heart disease despite all their turmeric . why would we care about boosting curcumin levels ? learn why in my videos which spices fight inflammation ? and spicing up dna protection , turmeric curcumin and rheumatoid arthritis , and turmeric curcumin and osteoarthritis . it ’ s also good to know who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric . i ’ ve previously covered this topic of food synergy in videos such as apples and oranges : dietary diversity and garden variety anti-inflammation that emphasize the importance of eating a variety of plant foods to take advantage of some of these interactions . the black pepper mechanism reminds me of the grapefruit ( tell your doctor if you eat grapefruit ) and broccoli ( the best detox ) stories . a testament to the power of plants . the painkilling properties of aspirin mentioned in the video are actually found throughout the plant kingdom : aspirin levels in plant foods . in some circumstances , traditional medicine wisdom seems incredible ( tomato effect ) ; in others , dangerous ( get the lead out ) . but that ’ s what we now have science for ! what about grapefruit ? and does blocking it every day pose a risk , by disabling detoxification of other substances ? would by that line of thought taking in pepper or grapefruit a few days a week be safer than every single day ? good questions athan . i look forward to the replies.awesome info as always dr gexactly my thought . we dump on many medical drugs because their method of action is often throwing a monkey wrench in a normal metabolic process , ignoring the fact that nature put that process there for a reason . i hope we get more nutritionfacts information on this broader , interesting matter.people don ’ t believe me but i love pepper in my smoothies . this is my flavor of the month : 1 / 2 hass avocado 3 / 4 c wild blueberries 1 / 4 t freshly ground black pepper 1 t turmeric 1 t ginger 1 t ceylon cinnamon 1 / 4 t cardamom 1 / 4 t cloves i ’ ll admit that i prefer mango to blueberries , but i go with the blueberries because they pack an even greater nutritional punch than mango . but , if you prefer mango , substitute 1 / 2 c mango for the blueberries , or maybe 1 / 4 c mango and 1 / 4 c pineapple . now , if you ’ re off sugar like i am , then this will be plenty sweet for you . if not , you may want to add something like erythritol . ( i personally couldn ’ t get behind the erythritol — i think it has a ‘ taste ’ . ) jane , in your ingredient list you have 1 t turmeric and 1 t ginger . is that teaspoon ? thanks , tomsmall t always means teaspoon in recipes.large t means tablespoon.yep , that ’ s one teaspoon turmeric and one teaspoon ginger . enjoy ! thanks for the recipe , jane , it will be my smoothie tomorrow : - ) it has all the essential spices in it . wonderful ! jane ’ s … what other liquid do you put in that smoothie ? do you use a bunch of ice or just water ? thanks ! just water . the wild blueberries are frozen , so they act as the ice.i love spicy food indian food . right by our office is a vegetarian / vegan indian restaurant that serves dal with a severe kick . i may go there today for my turmeric fix and will add extra pepper . dr. gregor , i wonder if i can use pabla indian buffet as a medical tax write off ? maybe if you write me a prescription ! i have a question . in the transcript dr. gregor mentions that the nutrients in turmeric is more absorbed with the addition of fat . do we need to add fat to our dishes or does the amount of fat that naturally occurs in vegetables suffice . i cook by water sauteing my vegetables , so i do not add any other fat other than what naturally occurs in whole plant foods . i was wondering if perhaps i would absorb more nutrients by adding a little olive oil or something.most fruits and vegetables have scant amounts of fat ( olives and avocado are the exceptions ) . grains don ’ t have much either . the best sources of whole plant-based fats are nuts , seeds and selected legumes ( soy / tofu in particular ) .sandy , i often use the water saute method for my vegetables too . a recent dr. greger post ( sorry i cannot recall at the moment which one ) suggests adding whole plant-based sources of fats , rather than extracted oils , to increase absorption of fat-soluble phytonutrients . ideas , as stevebillig mentions below are nuts and seeds , or a tahini ( made from sesame seeds ) dressing and olives would work too.great question ! i have been adding some oil-based salad dressing to my raw spinach , arugala , and kale leaves at dr. gregor ’ s suggestion . now i can see the need for adding butter to my steamed broccoli as well.wrong. dr.g doesn ’ t recommend butter or oil. stick to whole food plant sources of fats. nuts , seeds , avocados , olives. for example , avocado with your mexican food. olives with your pasta … seeds in your salad … lol . but butter tastes better . actually , i don ’ t use cow ’ s milk butter , but rather smart balance margarine . is using canola or walnut oil on broccoli better for you than butter ? certainly . the point was rather to compare trying to get the nutrition of vegetables in a dietarily insignificant amount of oil vs trying to get the nutrition of vegetables with no oil at all.if you must put something on your steamed broccoli or baked potato , try hummus ! there is a brand called world ’ s healthy gourmet that has only tahini in it … .no extracted oils ! whole foods carries it and some independent health food stores ! salsa is equally nice on them ! i take a capsule of turmeric , 400 mg . . sounds like i should take black pepper about same time . is i still effective to just use pepper at lunch / dinner ? wow , just the other day , dr. g confirmed for me that pepper is required to increase the bio-availability of curcumin ( when taken alone ) , but is not necessary to add to turmeric . that seems to be confirmed in the body of the article , but the title threw me off : “ why pepper boosts turmeric blood levels . ” i just hope i ’ m getting it right because i just bought a pound of turmeric and love adding it to my smoothies … but i haven ’ t been adding the pepper.well , in that case black pepper is going in my smoothie tomorrow : - ) but what about this recent study ?

20 mg / kg piperine didn ’ t adversely effect the curcumin effects . the higher dose of 40 mg / kg did , and elevated alt & ast indicates some liver toxicity . 40 mg / kg in a mouse , using fda conversion factors , scales to 225 mg piperine for a 70kg human , the amount in 2.2 tsp of ground black pepper.and you were doing so great ! mg / kg , mg / kg , mg / kg , mg , kg and then it all went south … . 2.2 tsp = voodoo science , even though your american beverage industry doesn ’ t think so : ) http : / / youtu.be / mepxbjjsnxs ? t = 8m48sthanks for replying . i was surprised to see this . the subjects were rats . all of the dosages were pretty large weren ’ t they . the figures for blood sugar seem to show that curcumin alone was the most effective , followed by piperine ; the combinations were less effective , with the high dose piperine combination the worst . surprising.thanks for the link to indian cooking fats . india contains so many different food cultures . there are areas where ghee is the primary cooking fat ; others which use sesame or coconut oil . the area i know best is bengal where mustardy flavors are loved , and mustard oil is the traditional cooking fat . lots of modern bengalis , worried about erucic acid , cook with peanut oil and add mustard oil at the end for flavor . mustard oil is dark gold , a little thick , and amazingly aromatic . it ’ s the one oil that still tempts me occasionally . i don ’ t think black pepper is commonly used in indian food any more ; tho it was the original peppery spice used in everything , it ’ s mostly been supplanted by the new world chilies , used whole or as chili powders.i ’ ve altered my prior post ( i had 3 tabs open on mouse studies ) . 3.7 tsp is a lot of black pepper.i love mustard oil , which at the local indian grocery is imported in the same bottles as sold in india , but labeled for massage use , for anyone on a low-fat plant based diet , aromatic oils like sesame and mustard are a great finishing touch.you nailed it darryl ! the only free oils i ever use , and only rarely , are toasted sesame , a few drops upon serving , and a gift from my sister of truffle oil , used the same way . either can totally change the character of a dish , and take it out of the realm of the ordinary for special occasions.their traditional knowledge certainly failed them with gheeghee is mostly for restaurant fare . many more indians cook at home with less expensive sunflower , peanut , or mustard oil . while sunflower and peanut oil didsn ’ t fare any better than ghee in this case control study , those who cooked with mustard oil appeared to have half the cardiovascular risk , and those who fried with mustard oil only a quarter of the risk , as the reference group which cooked with sunflower oil . as rats and pigs ( unlike humans ) accumulate erucic acid in their hearts , since the 1970s mustard oil has been labeled “ external use only ” in the us . canola oil is similar , replacing nearly all the erucic with oleic acid , though with a poorer ω-3 / ω-6 ratio.canola oil still has an ω-3 / ω-6 ratio of 1 : 2 , which is decent enough . it is probably close the overall optimum intake ratio ( which might be anywhere between 1 : 1 and 4 : 1 ) . while i ’ m at it , let me dispel the common myth that canola oil is made from some genetically modified “ frankenstein crop ” . the rape cultivars used for the production of canola oil have been conventionally bred to substitute oleic acid for the ( probably benign ) erucic acid and to greatly reduce the content of glucosinolates ( no , not the toxic substances some tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists make out of them , but the same beneficial , pungent-tasting anti-cancer compounds found in cruciferous vegetables ) . they are very popular in europe , where genetically modified cultivars are not even allowed . in northern america , most rape cultivars grown for human consumption have been genetically modified only subsequently to make them resistant to monsanto ’ s herbicide roundup – like many other crops . if you don ’ t shy away from oil in general i think that unrefined , expeller-pressed canola oil ( which has a nice nutty flavor and still some glucosinolates ) makes a great complement to virgin olive oil.timar : re : “ … dispel the common myth … ” great post ! i have a hard time explaining to people that canola oil is not something to feared . i try to stay away from all oils myself . but if i ’ m going to have an oil , i think that canola oil is a very good choice.dr. gregor , does it matter what type of fat when combining turmeric and fat to enhance absorbtion ? will olive oil or coconut oil yield the same result as dairy or animal fat ? “ one of the ways our liver gets rid of foreign substances is making them water soluble so they can be more easily excreted . but this black pepper molecule inhibits that process . ” so does this mean that pepper is actually very bad for you when put on seared beef or chicken ? dr. greger : thank you for the wonderful , life-changing and life-saving information you provide . my comment on your statement : “ one of the ways our liver gets rid of foreign substances is making them water soluble so they can be more easily excreted . but this black pepper molecule inhibits that process . ” in my case , i don ’ t want to inhibit this process ! who knows how such inhibition affects us ? potent curcumin effects can be obtained in multiple ways , including via the ucla formulation that does not contain oil or piperine and has been shown to remove amyloid plaques , as well as the japanese formulation theracurmin . ‘ how is it prepared in india ?

47	foods that fight osteoarthritis & inflammation osteoarthritis is the most frequent cause of physical disability among older adults in the world , affecting more than 20 million americans . it is estimated that 20 % of us will be affected in the coming decades and it is becoming more and more widespread among younger people . can anti-inflammatory foods help with this disease ? osteoarthritis is characterized by loss of cartilage in the joint . we used to think it was just mechanical wear and tear , but is “ now generally accepted to be an active joint disease with a prominent inflammatory component . ” this is supported by the fact that , for example , there is significantly higher production of inflammatory prostaglandins from tissue samples obtained from the knees of people suffering from the disease . if the loss of cartilage is caused by inflammation , an anti-inflammatory diet may indeed help . a recent review concluded that using optimal nutrition and exercise as the “ first-line ” intervention in the management of chronic osteoarthritis could well constitute the best medical practice . what does “ optimal nutrition ” look like ? the china study “ showed the serious health consequences of high consumption of pro-inflammatory foods ( meat , dairy , fat , and junk ) and low consumption of anti-inflammatory plant foods ( whole grains , vegetables and fruits , and beans , split peas , chickpeas and lentils ) . ” the unnatural western diet “ contributes to low-grade systemic inflammation , and oxidative tissue stress and irritation , placing the immune system in an overactive state , a common denominator of conditions such as arthritis . ” there are phytonutrients in plants that appear to help decrease the degradation of the joint cartilage , inflammatory activity , cell death and oxidative damage . this is based largely on in vitro studies , suggesting protective benefits of soy , pomegranates , citrus , grapes , green tea , and the curry powder spice turmeric . but my patients are people , not petri dishes . what role might the yellow pigment curcumin in turmeric play in the treatment of osteoarthritis ? obesity doesn ’ t just put more stress on our joints . the fatty tissue inside our joints — like in the kneecap itself — is a source of pro inflammatory chemicals that have been shown to increase cartilage degradation . curcumin may not only help prevent the release of inflammatory chemicals , but may also slow the formation of the fat pad in the first place . but this has all been in test tubes . there have been two clinical studies published to date . the latest study took 50 patients suffering from mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and gave them either the best available medical treatment , which included control with anti-inflammatory drugs and pain-killers , or the best available treatment along with some proprietary curcumin supplement . they looked at a number of different outcome measures , including the karnofsky scale which goes up to 100 ( normal , no evidence of disease ) , down to zero , at which you ’ re dead . the group with the added curcumin did significantly better , and were able to double their walking distance ( see the results in my video , turmeric curcumin and osteoarthritis ) . the curcumin group was also able to significantly decrease their drug use , side-effects , swelling hospitalizations , and other treatments . but it doesn ’ t have to be some fancy proprietary formula . in the other study , “ the efficacy of turmeric extracts in patients with knee osteoarthritis , ” about a hundred sufferers were randomized to ibuprofen or concentrated turmeric extracts for six weeks , and the curcumin group did as good or better than the ibuprofen group . even though ibuprofen is over-the-counter , it can cause ulceration bleeding and perforation of the stomach and intestines ( that is , it can eat right through your stomach wall ) . in fact , that happened to someone in the study . whereas the side-effects of curcumin include potentially protecting against a long list of diseases . what about rheumatoid arthritis ? see turmeric curcumin and rheumatoid . also check out boosting the bioavailability of curcumin and who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric . i think the only other video i have on osteoarthritis is rose hips for osteoarthritis . those unfamiliar with the china study should read it ! i also mention it in my video china study on sudden cardiac death . if , as described , oxidative stress and inflammation both play a role in joint inflammation , then that may help explain the role of turmeric . see my videos which spices fight inflammation ? and spicing up dna protection . if you ’ re going to get turmeric from food instead of supplements , should it be raw or cooked to get the anti-arthritis benefits described here ? i remember from previous blogs that some benefits of turmeric come from cooked and some come from raw.from the “ dna protecting spices ” blog entry , it appears that raw is indicated for inflammation ( the suffix “ -itis ” generally denoting inflammation ) : “ in terms of dna damage , the results from raw turmeric did not reach statistical significance . however , the opposite was found for its anti-inflammatory effects . ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 01 / 22 / the-top-three-dna-protecting-spices / adding pepper to turmeric to inhibit liver enzyme production is fine for promoting curcumin uptake , but what about inhibiting normal liver function that is designed to remove other substances the liver sees as waste products or harmful compounds ? seems to me this is getting a little dicey . those enzymes are there for very good , health promoting reasons . let ’ s not get so absorbed in food as allotropic medicine and get back to trusting ordinary whole foods ( whole grains , vegetables , fruits , and legumes ) as the best way to build and maintain health . once you start down the food-as-medicine path you need to get concerned about dose , frequency , and unintended consequences . i hear those concerns coming out in the comments below . back to basics , people.agree with you dr. dave , though not sure why you are addressing this to me ? i am not a medical person or researcher . while considering ordering piperine ( black pepper fruit extract ) to up my absorption of turmeric , i found this study done on rats , http : / / journals.plos.org / plosone / article ? id = 10.1371 / journal.pone.0113993 , which indicates that piperine nullifies the antidiabetic and antioxidant activities of curcumin . i love black pepper so will continue consuming it as a condiment ; however , i am not going to use the extract.further reading , leads me to believe that ginger increases the efficacy of turmeric and possibly other nutrients . i am now adding 1 / 8 t. ginger powder to water and drinking it before taking my organic india turmeric capsules which also include curcumin extract . i am also drinking the ginger powder water as i am weaning myself off ibuprofen and it does help cut down on my pain and inflammation . in addition , i add 1 / 4 t. of ginger powder to my morning smoothie.there is video about turmeric and how much better it works when you ingest it with black pepper . make sure to check that out as well.when i take my turmeric supplement ( i also eat curries but not often enough ) i also make sure to have black pepper along with it just to make sure that i get max bang for the buck … or bang for the spice if you prefer.yes yes yes on the ground black pepper inclusion ! it has been proven to increase our absorption of this mighty plant food ! i ’ ve read that both fresh and dried ( powder ) turmeric is equally good for our bodies ! ! ! yay ! your memory serves you well ! consuming turmeric as a whole food , either fresh or dried , or as a powder can boost its bioavailability . combining the powder with fat in a meal as they do in india helps turmeric be absorbed right into the blood stream . see this video for more details : boosting the bioavailability of curcurminhow much “ concentrated turmeric extracts ” should one take ? how much per capsule and how many capsules per day ? i just take a capsule that has turmeric in it in the same dry and powder form as if you were to put it into your cooking , i have never seen an extract but they are probably out there.i thought about capsules , but for me they cost too much . so now i mix my grocery-store turmeric with applesauce . usually i put it on a small plate ( an orange one natch ) and lick it all up , every last granule . however suits each of us is fine.putting the turmeric in apple sauce is actually a pretty cool idea.does the apple sauce kill the flavor , or is it just enough to tolerate ? i actually like the flavor . however , a little bit of as / turmeric and some cinnamon ? use curry that you like with the turm in it ? mint oil ? etc ? check out this video for your answer http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 02 / 12 / who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin / the video who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric is helpful and discusses who might want to avoid turmeric and how much may be helpful / harmful.is concentrate tumeric ( gold milk ) dangerous with anticoagulant ? i read it can cause bleeding.hi france ! are you referring to gold milk as in the ayurvedic recipe for cooking some turmeric powder in milk ? if so , you do not need to worry about consuming gold milk ( say , turmeric powder cooked in some soymilk or almond milk ) with anticoagulant medications . like who many products , however , it can become difficult to determine the drug-nutrient interactions with food concentrates . so typically , your safest course of action is to consume turmeric in levels one would normally find in regular dietary amounts . you can find more information about the possible concerns regarding turmeric consumption in the video who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric ? thank you for the answer , and yes i was referring to the ayurvedic recipe.the link to the review doesn ’ t work … just sends me to the national science library.hi bruce , i got the same result when clicking on it . i ’ m guessing this is the actual source : http : / / www.hindawi.com / journals / arthritis / 2012 / 560634 / raw ? cooked ? capsules ? in food ? how much ? kathryn there are a bunch of videos on turmeric . go to browse topics below.yes , doc greger has a bunch of awesome turmeric videos … i think they are among his best videos ! ! ! thanks ! i don ’ t like the taste of turmeric in food . is capsule form equally as good or better ? if so , how much and how often is required to derive benefit ? check out this video . if you take it with black pepper the bioavailability of the curcumin in turmeric should increase enough to make capsules just as effective.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin / thanks ! i can ’ t use black pepper to enhance the effectiveness of turmeric . what other options are there ? wiki + wiki = grapefruit and pomegranate , seem to block the same enzyme . but most of us will have seen warnings about grapefruit on medication , could be a bit too strong an inhibitor.nf team ? should one use the capsules of circummin & black pepper , even though that one is adding turmeric .. ( grocery store spice ) to cereal , and a small amount in cooking as well ? ? believe this one or not , but i actually put black pepper ( 12 to 15 turns on my pepper mill ) straight into my smoothies . i do have tons of fruit in there as well along with some greens so i cannot even taste it at all . it could be that i am used to it.try it in smoothies if you get the chance . use fresh ground and just start off with a couple of turns of the mill to see how it works for you.i take turmeric in capsules or sometimes i just eat indian curries . i tried putting turmeric into foods myself but a little goes a long ways and i have more than ruined a few meals so i stick to capsules or a vegetarian / vegan indian restaurant option.as a side note – my smoothies end up right around 2 quarts when they are done blending so if you make smaller ones , cut back the pepper for sure.mjs _ 28s : i do believe it ! several years ago , i got a recipe from pcrm for “ mango lassi ” that included black pepper in addition to frozen mango , non-dairy milk , and dates . ( i think that was it . there may have been one other ingredient . ) i was surprised at the inclusion of the black pepper , but it works * really * well . it helps to balance out the sweet taste in a good way . so , i totally see black peoper working with smoothies.one also has to pay attention to the quality of the turmeric ; in some cases lead has been added as a filler ( think of the lovely yellow colour in old paintings … ) – so it is best to get organic turmeric ! lead … ? i would like to know more detail about thism as in … who … when … where … links … source of info ! i ’ ve noticed a reduction in arthritis pain with turmeric capsules along with an allergen free plant diet . thanks for all these videos on the value of turmeric . also , thanks for the further advice to stick to that china study diet . all you all plant docs saved my life with your research and education . thanks.must the black pepper be taken right after the capsule or can it be take just with food the same or next day ? does anyone know if this would be helpful for dupretins disease ? as far as i am aware , diet has no known role in dupuytren ’ s disease . the article linked below summarises current knowledge : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1963648 / someone asked for the amount of cumin – with all the authorities on here a simple answer would be nice rather than having someone do all the research ! hello genera , 1 / 3 tsp or 0.2 cl of turmeric ( curcumin is within ) daily is considered safe per the video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 02 / 12 / who-should-be-careful-about-curcumin / where can you purchase turmeric , in all forms ? reliable , reputable source that supplies us with what it says it is ? amazon sells a few brands of organic turmeric powder and several brands of capsules . it ’ s a good idea to buy organic turmeric because most of the turmeric sold in the us comes from india , which has to feed more than one billion people . to do that they have to maximize crop yields . the only way to do that is to use pesticide . there ’ re laws on pesticide usage but nobody follows them because of corrupt bureaucrats . they reportedly use some pesticides banned here decades ago.i have been juicing turmeric root in my green veggie juices . is this an efficient way to reap the benefits of this spice ? stan , approximately 100 g of turmeric provides 53 % of dietary fiber , one of its many benefits . here ’ s a reminder of what happens when juicing foods : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / juicing-removes-more-than-just-fiber / i have been using turmeric as an anti-inflammatory for a while . i take a high-quality turmeric supplement . the benefits i ’ ve experienced from the turmeric have been impressive … it helps my pain and swelling just was well as the stuff my dr. prescribed . however , the turmeric doesn ’ t upset my stomach at all . i am learning more and more about the health benefits of turmeric that even go beyond it ’ s anti-inflammatory capabilities and am always looking for new ways to use turmeric in my diet. aging , alternative medicine , animal fat , arthritis , autoimmune diseases , beans , cartilage health , chickpeas , china study , citrus , complementary medicine , curcumin , dairy , exercise , fat , fruit , grains , grapes , green tea , ibuprofen , immune function , inflammation , joint disease , joint health , junk food , lentils , meat , medications , obesity , osteoarthritis , oxidative stress , pain , phytonutrients , polyphenols , pomegranates , saturated fat , soy , spices , split peas , standard american diet , tea , turmeric , vegetables - -
49	the spice that helps ease rheumatoid arthritis pain according to the world health organization , “ 80 % of the earth ’ s inhabitants rely upon the traditional medicine for their primary health-care needs , in part due to high cost of western pharmaceuticals . medicines derived from plants have played a pivotal role in the health care of both ancient and modern cultures . ” one of the prime sources of plant-derived medicines is spices . turmeric , for example , has been consumed over the centuries around the world . turmeric is known by different names in different societies — my favorite of which is probably “ zard-choobag . ” turmeric is the dried powdered root stalks of the turmeric plant — a member of the ginger family — from which the orangey-yellow pigment curcumin can be extracted . the spice turmeric is what makes curry powder yellow , and curcumin is what makes turmeric yellow . in the video , turmeric curcumin and rheumatoid arthritis , you can see the molecular structure of curcumin . i always thought it kind of looked like a crab . in recent years , more than 5,000 articles have been published in the medical literature about curcumin . many sport impressive looking diagrams suggesting curcumin can benefit a multitude of conditions via a dizzying array of mechanisms . curcumin was first isolated more than a century ago , but out of the thousands of experiments , just a handful in the 20th century were clinical studies , involving actual human participants . most of the 5,000 were just in vitro lab studies , which i ’ ve resisted covering until the studies moved out of the petri dish and into the person . but since the turn-of-the-century , more than 50 clinical trials have been done , testing curcumin against a variety of human diseases , with 84 more on the way . one such study got my attention . rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that causes progressive destruction of the cartilage and bone of joints . the long-term prognosis of ra is poor , with as much as 80 % of patients affected becoming disabled with a reduced life expectancy . there are lots of drugs one can take , but unfortunately they ’ re often associated with severe side effects including blood loss , bone loss and bone marrow suppression , and toxicity to the liver and eyes . the efficacy of curcumin was first demonstrated over 30 years ago in a double-blind crossover study : curcumin versus phenylbutazone , a powerful anti-inflammatory that is used in race horses . both groups showed significant improvement in morning stiffness , walking time , and joint swelling , with the complete absence of any side effects from curcumin ( which is more than can be said for phenylbutazone , which was pulled from the market three years later after wiping out people ’ s immune systems and their lives ) . in the new study , 45 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized into three groups : curcumin , the standard of care drug , or both . the primary endpoint was a reduction in disease activity as well as a reduction in joint tenderness and swelling . all three groups got better , but interestingly the curcumin groups showed the highest percentage of improvement , significantly better than those in the drug group . the findings are significant and demonstrate that curcumin alone was not only safe and effective , but surprisingly more effective in alleviating pain compared to the leading drug of choice , all without any adverse side effects . in fact , curcumin appeared protective against drug side effects , given that there were more adverse reactions in the drug group than in the combined drug and curcumin group . in contrast to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , curcumin has no gastrointestinal side effects , and may even protect the lining of the stomach . hard to appreciate the gorgeous color of fresh turmeric root unless you see it for yourself . you should be able to find it at any large asian store . i incorporate it into my natural nausea remedy recipe . the inner color is almost fluorescent ! i ’ m afraid followers of nutritionfacts.org are going to get sick of turmeric , but there ’ s a load of important new research i felt i needed to cover . so far there ’ s turmeric curcumin and osteoarthritis , boosting the bioavailability of curcumin and who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric ? i ’ ve previously talked about treating autoimmune joint inflammation with diets full of plants in diet & rheumatoid arthritis and potassium and autoimmune disease . if phenylbutazone sounds vaguely familiar , maybe you read my q & a is horse meat safe to eat ? i for one love hearing all of this great new information about turmeric and i highly doubt i ’ ll ever get sick of it . keep it up ! there ’ s lots of great information regarding the extracts from turmeric . how beneficial is it to nosh the raw root ? if it is beneficial , how much should one eat daily ? so all this happens without black pepper ? costco is now selling turmeric in capsules … is this as good as cooking with it ? i find it hard to eat a regular diet of turmeric … .in boosting the bioavailability of curcumin and who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric ? , i just found most of the answers to the question i posted 33 minutes ago.please write some materials on which forms of circumin / turmeric are best to use . for example , is it good to take the gel caplets sold by some places such as puritan ’ s pride ? i quit that brand once they began using those transparent colored plastic bottles . mind-boggling stupidity to store light-sensitive nutrients in such things.do you know the transparency of the plastic bottles ? there may not be much uv-visible light getting through . as a safety measure they are superior to glass , they seem to be readily recyclable . i would not call that mind-boggling stupidity . charity can go some way to ease one ’ s sense of sharing values in life.pretty easy way to incorporate turmeric daily is to add 1 tea spoon of turmeric to boiling brown rice + some ground black pepper . the rice has a great colour and pretty decent taste . you can also add a spoon of olive oil , but i found that when i add oil the rice is a bit hard after 30 minutes of cooking . also use the exact amount of water that will be absorbed by rice so you don ’ t lose anything.i ’ m not tired of hearing about the benefits of turmeric . it ’ s my # 1 spice for fighting inflammation and joint pain . i went from dreading mowing the lawn and using the railing going down stairs ( wondering if my knee might give out ) to now doing different exercises during the wk . like walking , squats holding a 25lb dumbbell , lunges ( very tuff for bad knees ) and squat thrusts for cardio and getting the blood flowing good . i was even able to include chin-ups and pull-ups again . no way you can do them with sore elbows at age 59.i don ’ t care for turmeric in my food but i have no problem dabbing some in 3 or 4 cups of hot green tea throughout the day.full disclosure , i can ’ t give turmeric the full credit for eliminating my joint pain when 18 months ago i also eliminated all sugar , cakes , soda , and cookies . all dairy , eggs , and meat . and most processed food except for some cereal and bread . just recently added back some sardines for some extra omega 3 and vit d source.going on a diet of greens , beans , nuts , fruit and veggies was a massive change for me being a life long meat eater 3 times a day . i wasn ’ t sure my body would survive the shock … lol but it seems to be what my body wanted as i ’ ve seen many improvements , not just the joint pain.and getting the daily emails from dr greger and nutrition facts does a good job of keeping me on the right track with the latest nutrition reinforcement . thanks , garyi and my dogs have been taking turmeric for about the last 3-4 weeks . two of my dogs are 13yo and active . though they show a bit less stiffness they are far better than before we started taking the spice . there is a closed group on fb that is run by a veterinarian in australia called turmeric user group . some of the results are astounding . cancers are disappearing , stiffness is replaced by flexibility . these are not clinical trials , just ordinary people willing to help their animals and themselves . does it work for everyone ? no . some of that has to do with the preparation and dosage . those that are getting the best results are using organic turmeric powder . most make it into what is called the golden paste which combines the powder with water and cooked over a low / med heat . after 7-10 minutes fresh ground black pepper and either coconut ( cold pressed / organic ) or olive oil ( cold pressed / organic ) is added . this batch is then allowed to cool and then put into sterilized jars and kept in the fridge . it will keep up to 4 weeks but is advised to consume within 2 . it is also best to take it a few times during the day for it doesn ’ t seem to stay in the body very long.kathi : thank you so much for this post ! i have an aging dog whom i love so much . i ’ m going to give this a try ! kathi : follow up questions : why is oil added at the end ? does it make it taste better / easier to consume for the dog . or is there an assumed health benefit ? also , what is the typical dosage given ? ( fyi : i have a giant breed dog . ) thanks ! do you recommend supplements over powdered turmeric for people with kidney stones . are there no oxalates in the supplements ? dr. g i could never get sick of hearing about the benefits of – anything . even turmeric . : - ) i use it all the time now ! with pepper . ; - ) btw i ’ d have to guess that a pure 100 % capsules of turmeric powder is fine.what is the best way to heat turmeric ? you have mentioned that only the heated version of turmeric has dna repair properties.i ’ m an immigrant from south asia and have been eating turmeric all my life . in small amounts , turmeric is tasteless ; in large amounts , it ’ s bitter . this means you can add turmeric to anything in small amounts . i add it to rice dishes , curries , pasta sauces , soups , chili , stir-fry , baked foods , and so on.nice tip ! that the reality we need more eticca medical system ( and le interested on money ) what jane ’ s said . never get tired oh cooking with , eating ( or drinking ) , or hearing about turmuric.my grandmother has one of the most severe cases of ra recorded in michigan and has suffered its crippling effects for years , along with terrible side effects of countless harsh drugs . however , last year she started taking doses of turmeric powder , and miraculously has been able to get off most of her medications ! ! ! her ra doc and everyone else is astounded . she has more energy and less pain than she ’ s had in years , it ’ s really quite amazing . the person that recommended it to her was my aunt , who suffers from fibromyalgia and takes turmeric , which also helps her inflammation . thanks for spreading the word about this amazing yellow root . : ) i ’ m going to second that ! though i also dramatically changed my diet which improved other health issues , tumeric has been a real blessing for ra and fibromyalgia , not to mention some really painful back issues , and even mental function . i had actually been on narcotics for almost 10 years because i was essentially bed ridden otherwise , and have been able to wean off of them completely . i am not pain free , but it is manageable now , i can even ride a bike ! i used to think that people who were into the “ health kick ” were fringe lunatics , and now i am one and so grateful ! … a happy grandmother ! a caveat here is the possiblility of ingesting contaminated “ natural remedies . ” poisonous herbs , lead , arsenic , ddt and pcbs often contaminate “ natural ” products . check your garden or farm products for up to 200 noxious contaminants ( take them to a friendly lab like at a technicn or university – or use the pathology lab ) . otherwise , purchase your products from nutriceutical companies that manufacture under a pharmaceutical licence and strict good manufacturung practice , companies which check all their products for contaminants and guarantee high purity , quality and potency of products from human food farm produce – not rocks and sea algae not usually eaten by human-beings.clicking the link to “ who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric ? ” leads to the video “ boosting the bioavailability of curcumin ” instead.mmr , thanks for pointing that out so we can get it fixed.i understand you should consume black pepper while using turmeric.yes , with its piperine ~ 1 % of the curcumin in turmeric . since piperine is roughly 5-9 % of black pepper and curcumin 3 % of turmeric powder , black pepper should be a scant ½ % of turmeric . for turmeric as dry powder , ¼ to ½ gram dose is common . how many turns of black pepper that averages , i haven ’ t yet measured ; i use 7-8 , likely too high.every day you use take turmeric or can you just use black pepper daily on food or otherwise ? i have turmeric twice daily with black pepper , but you can also put pepper on various other foods , since it seems to potentiate many nutrients . bon appetit ! i ’ ve seen the same gi intolerance in some patients with cox hypersensitivity occur with curcumin . wish it weren ’ t so . not common , but more than absent.i have crohn ’ s disease , which is also an auto-immune disease . this may be anecdotal , but a bowl of indian food has always felt like comfort food to me . the link to turmeric suddenly makes sense . the responses to this article have given me some great ideas on ways to add more turmeric to my diet . thanks.i was getting sick of hearing about all the benefits of turmeric , but then i ate some turmeric and my sickness went away.how could we ever “ get sick ” of your health-delivering information ?

50	the top three dna protecting spices in my video which spices fight inflammation ? i profile a landmark study that compared the ability of different spices to suppress inflammation . the study also compared the spices ’ ability to protect dna . cloves , ginger , rosemary , and turmeric were able to significantly stifle the inflammatory response , but can they also protect dna ? if a tissue sample is taken from a random person , about 7 % of their cells may show evidence of dna damage , actual breaks in the strands of their dna . if we then blast those cells with free radicals , we can bring that number up to 10 % . but if the person has been eating ginger for a week , dna damage drops to just 8 % . in the video , spicing up dna protection , you can see a comparison of dna damage in cells from people eating different spices . those who hadn ’ t been eating any herbs or spices were vulnerable to dna damage from oxidative stress . but just including ginger in our diet may cut that damage by 25 % — the same with rosemary . turmeric is even more powerful — dna damage was cut in half . and this was not just mixing turmeric with cells in some petri dish : this is comparing what happens when you expose the cells of spice eaters versus the cells of non-spice eaters to free radicals and count the dna fracture rates . and not only did the turmeric work significantly better , but it did so at a significantly smaller dose . one and a third teaspoons a day of ginger or rosemary was compared to practically just a pinch of turmeric ( about an eighth of a teaspoon a day ) — that ’ s how powerful the stuff is . i encourage everyone to cook with this wonderful spice . it tastes great and may protect every cell in our body , with or without the added stress . counting the dna breaks in people ’ s cells before and after a week of spices without the free radical blast revealed no significant intrinsic protection in the ginger or rosemary groups . however , the turmeric still appeared to reduce dna damage by half . this may be because curcumin is not just an antioxidant — it also boosts the activity of the body ’ s own antioxidant enzymes . catalase is one of the most active enzymes in the body : each one can detoxify millions of free radicals per second . if we consume the equivalent of about three quarters of a teaspoon of turmeric a day , the activity of this enzyme in our bloodstream gets boosted by 75 % ! i suggest cooking with it rather than , for example , just throwing it in a smoothie . why ? because this effect was found specifically for heat-treated turmeric . in practice , many herbs and spices are only consumed after cooking , so the researchers tested turmeric and oregano in both raw and cooked forms . in terms of dna damage , the results from raw turmeric did not reach statistical significance . however , the opposite was found for its anti-inflammatory effects . so we might want to eat it both ways . “ practical recommendations for obtaining curcumin in the diet might be to add turmeric to sweet dishes containing cinnamon and ginger . ” i add it to my pumpkin pie smoothies ( a can of pumpkin , frozen cranberries , pitted dates , pumpkin pie spice and some nondairy milk ) . we can also cook with curry powder or turmeric itself . the researchers suggest something called “ turmeric milk , ” which is a traditional indian elixir made with milk , turmeric powder , and sugar . i ’ d suggest substituting a healthier sweetener and a healthier milk . soy milk , for example , might have a double benefit . if you ’ re taking turmeric to combat inflammation , osteoarthritis sufferers randomized to soy protein ended up with significantly improved joint range of motion compared to dairy protein . for some other extraordinary benefits of spices , see : there are a few herb and spice caveats . see , for example : too much turmeric may also not be a good idea for those at risk for kidney stones ( see oxalates in cinnamon ) . feel free to check out my healthy pumpkin pie recipe for another way to spice up your diet . oh … remember al in deadwood . stones are not good ! thank you dr. gregor . i used to absolutely hate powdered turmeric but found that the fresh form delicious . i find it next to the ginger root in many stores . fresh turmeric is delicious cooked with anything indian and even better used in ethiopian lemony yellow split peas called kik alicha . after discovering kik alicha , i also discovered the dry stuff isn ’ t too bad in it . sambar is also ok made with the powdered kind . capsules are another good way to get it down the gullet . i guess i make no sense , but want to say thank you for helping me in so many ways … even learning to like dried turmeric.dr. greger , did you also want to mention that the use of black pepper ( piperine ) when taken at the same time as the turmeric can boost blood levels of curcumin from the turmeric by up to 2,000 % ? swing dancer , i also wanted ask about the pepper ? is it essential to add it , or not ? maybe it just boosts the effects of something that is already pretty effective ? what about the pepper dr. greger ? yes it is , it blocks liver enzymes from transforming it.which method of heat treatment is most beneficial to use on turmeric ? there are many ways one could heat it . either in a water based medium or dry , and either using convection heat or microwave . i don ’ t want to ruin the benefits i need . also , i assume regular standard store-bought turmeric you find in the tins in the spice sectiopn is suitable for this purpose ? no oil … ! https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = b _ o4ybqpktqlooks like he is having a mild panic attack or breathlessness crisis there ^ ^ . anyway i ’ m pretty sure you should look at no oil as don ’ t eat oil for the sake of oil : do not drown your salads in olive oil , do no eat fries or potato chips laden with fat , avoid emulsified oils ( sauses ) or hardened oils ( spreadables ) .i think it is very unlikely he would push the discontinuation of all oil as either a heat conductor or transport medium of nutrients in carefully chosen tiny doses . both require very small amounts of oil and frankly cooking would become exceedingly difficult and bland without some of it sometimes.i agree . i can ’ t prepare a satisfying meal without some oil . in practice , “ no oil ” means “ no more oil than is necessary ” . perhaps , dr. greger will address this issue in detail.for what it ’ s worth , i dropped all oil use a few months ago and love my food more than ever before . i never would have imagined how easy it is to clean grease-free dishes.how much is too much turmeric ? how much do you recommend per day ? see this video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / oxalates-in-cinnamon / you can load a lot of turmeric and pepper into peanut butter , and spread it on bread or crackers . very tasty savory snack.pepper , oil , boiling … … too much guess work for me . i take a standardized preparation , curqfen . curcumin is combined with fiber derived from fenugreek to form a highly bioavailable , sustained release product that is both water and fat soluble and crosses the blood-brain barrier . i understand dr. greger ’ s distrust of supplements and “ fancy pills ” but the fact remains that of the 7000-plus curcumin studies cited in pub med , the overwhelming majority involve some form of enhanced delivery system.for example , the very study dr. greger cites in the above paragraph with the words “ boosts ” highlighted in green used a lipidated curcumin supplement called longvida.hi dr gregor , thanks for the info .. does that mean that raw turmeric had no reading for protection against dna damage ? or was it just that raw is better as an anti inflammatory ? i eat a heaped teaspoon with black pepper in water daily – im hoping this will also give me dna protection .. ? thanks ! ! kateahhh this brings backs memories of tumeric milk my mom would make me consume the minute she saw us getting sick … n i hated it but had to drink it . tumeric leaves a nasty stubborn stain on any counter so could never pour it down the drain or anywhere w / o my mom finding out ha ! ! hey guys , i was inspired by this blog post to find and / or create a turmeric smoothie , since dr. greger says we should be eating turmeric cooked and raw . so this is what i came up with ! 1 / 2 hass avocado 1 / 2 c frozen mango 1 / 2 t turmeric 1 / 2 t ginger 1 / 2 cinnamon a few cracks of black pepper ( yes , pepper in a smoothie ! ) : ) soymilk , almondmilk , or water ( i used water ) optional : erythritol or whatever sweetener you prefer ( i didn ’ t add a sweetener ) i actually loved this smoothie , even though i was afraid it would be gross . the ginger , cinnamon and pepper give it almost a chai kick , and the turmeric seemed to be working some magic in there too . and to me there ’ s nothing better than avocado and mango . so there you have it ! a delicious smoothie that lets you get the benefits of raw turmeric curcumin and black pepper piperine.it blocks cytokines involved in ovarian cancer tumor / cell milieu that cause inflammatory based metastasis and cell growth too ( emt theory . ) . i am hoping it can also get into the mitochondria to quench ros , vit e did not , , believed to cause multiple , random dna breaks , recombination , amplifications and deletions of tumor suppressors . as a brca1 + , preventing dna assaults , is one of my approaches to avoiud overloading the cell , and remaining good allele . thank you for your work . it is so validating and helpful to the cancer community.hey there – i ’ m curious – are these studies done on fresh turmeric , or turmeric powder ?

51	the top four anti-inflammatory spices once in a while i come across a study that ’ s so juicy i have to do a whole video about it ( which spices fight inflammation ? ) . a group of researchers at the university of florida , gainesville and pennsylvania state set up a brilliant experiment . we ’ ve known that ounce per ounce , herbs and spices have some of the greatest antioxidant activities known . but that ’ s only ever been tested in a test tube . before we can ask if an herb or spice has real health benefits , it is first necessary to determine whether it is bioavailable — whether the active ingredients are even absorbed . this had never been done , until now . the researchers could have taken the easy route and just measured the change in antioxidant level in one ’ s bloodstream before and after consumption , but the assumption that the appearance of antioxidant activity in the blood is an indication of bioavailability has a weakness . maybe more gets absorbed than we think but doesn ’ t show up on antioxidant tests because it gets bound up to proteins or cells . so the researchers attempted to measure physiological changes in the blood . they were interested in whether absorbed compounds would be able to protect white blood cells from an oxidative or inflammatory injury — whether herb and spice consumption would protect the strands of our dna from breaking when attacked by free radicals . i cover the dna findings in my video , spicing up dna protection . they also wondered if the consumption might alter cellular inflammatory responses in the presence of a physiologically relevant inflammatory insult . what does this all mean ? the researchers took a bunch of people and had each of them eat different types of spices for a week . there were many truly unique things about this study , but one was that the quantity of spices that study subjects consumed was based on the usual levels of consumption in actual food . for example , the oregano group was given a half teaspoon a day — a practical quantity that people might actually eat once in a while . at the end of the week , they drew blood from the dozen or so people they had adding , for example , black pepper to their diets that week , and compared the effects of their blood to the effects of the blood of the dozen subjects on cayenne , or cinnamon , or cloves , or cumin . they had about ten different groups of people eating about ten different spices . then they dripped their plasma ( the liquid fraction of their blood ) onto human white blood cells in a petri dish that had been exposed to an inflammatory insult . the researchers wanted to pick something really inflammatory , so they chose oxidized cholesterol ( which is what we ’ d get in our bloodstream after eating something like fried chicken . if oxidized cholesterol is a new concept for you , please check out its role in heart disease progression in my video arterial acne ) . so they jabbed the white blood cells with oxidized cholesterol and measured how much tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) they produced in response . tnf is a powerful inflammatory cytokine , infamous for the role it plays in autoimmune attacks like inflammatory bowel disease . compared to the blood of those who ate no spices for a week , black pepper was unable to significantly dampen the inflammatory response . what about any of the other spices ? the following significantly stifled the inflammatory response : and remember , they weren ’ t dripping the spices themselves on these human white blood cells , but the blood of those who ate the spices . so the results represents what might happen when cells in our body are exposed to the levels of spices that circulate in our bloodstream after normal daily consumption — not megadoses in some pill . just the amount that makes our spaghetti sauce , pumpkin pie , or curry sauce taste good . there are drugs that can do the same thing . tumor necrosis factors are such major mediators of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases that there are tnf-blocking drugs on the market for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , psoriasis , and ankylosing spondylitis , which collectively rake in more than $ 20 billion a year ( $ 15,000 – $ 20,000 per person per year ) . at that price , the side effects better be hugs and rainbows . but no , the drugs carry a so-called “ black box warning ” because they can cause things like cancer and heart failure . if only there was a cheaper , safer solution . the spice curcumin , the yellow pigment in turmeric , is substantially cheaper and safer , but does it work outside of a test tube ? there ’ s evidence that it may help in all of the diseases for which tnf blockers are currently being used . so with health-care costs and safety being such major issues , this golden spice turmeric may help provide the solution . see antioxidants in a pinch and how to reach the antioxidant rda to see the extent to which even small amounts of spices can affect one ’ s antioxidant intake . another elegant series of “ ex vivo ” experiments exploring the cancer fighting power of lifestyle changes can be seen in the videos starting with ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay . mushrooms ( boosting immunity while reducing inflammation ) , nuts ( fighting inflammation in a nut shell ) , and purple potatoes ( anti-inflammatory effects of purple potatoes ) may also reduce inflammation ( along with plant foods in general , see anti-inflammatory antioxidants and aspirin levels in plant foods ) . in fact so well that plant-based diets can be used to treat inflammatory conditions . see , for example , dietary treatment of crohn ’ s disease , diet & rheumatoid arthritis , and potassium and autoimmune disease . animal products on the other hand may increase inflammation through a variety of mechanisms , including endotoxins ( how does meat cause inflammation ? ) , arachidonic acid ( chicken , eggs , and inflammation ) , and neu5gc ( the inflammatory meat molecule neu5gc ) . great article . thank you . i was surprised that cinnamon was not on the list . was that tested ? sounds like it was tested , phil . “ … .. and compared the effects of their blood to the effects of the blood of the dozen subjects on cayenne , or cinnamon , or cloves , or cumin . ” and i was surprised that cayenne wasn ’ t one of the four . i never would have guess cloves. http : / / www.globalhealingcenter.com / natural-health / benefits-of-cayenne-pepper / this article perhaps in part shows that some spices can blunt the impact of meat eating , igf-1 spikes , or other kinds of inflammation . this is the same list of spices that is recommended as the best at fighting cancer in vitro . the only spice recommended as high in orac but not included here is oregano , which does not seem to be a known cancer fighter but is rich in anti-oxidants . cloves , rosemary , tumeric ( maybe with pepper ) , and ginger should be eaten daily to reduce cancer risk and inflammation risk . drinking a cup or two of chai or other cloves and ginger tea daily could add years to life or reduce injury . rosemary tumeric , cloves , and ginger are all spices available in tea , are all known cancer fighters , and can reduce inflammation based health issues that can accumulate in life.you mentioned tumeric with maybe black pepper … you might be interested in dr. greger ’ s video … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / boosting-the-bioavailability-of-curcumin / if you haven ’ t seen it.good information but best 5 out of 10 is not much of a contesti have to loose confidence of what is said here , cayenne pepper deserves to be one of best.cayenne pepper does have its place here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 04 / 15 / cayenne-for-irritable-bowel / i wonder if it ’ s possible to eat too much of these spices ? yes . because of oxalate absorption , keep it under a teaspoon of turmeric a day. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / oxalates-in-cinnamon / i wouldn ’ t go overboard on any of these . small amounts are plenty . everything is toxic in large amounts . except whole fruit apparently ; ) ashton kutcher ate only whole fruit and ended up in the hospital . there is such a thing as too much fruit.too much fruit is only too much fruit if it replaces all other foods . ashton kutcher ate nothing but fruit . if he ate that much fruit in addition to a diet of whole grains , beans , greens and veggies , he would have had no problem.dr greger , i guess it would be considered a spice , but i am really curious if you can find out any legitimate info on nigella sativa , the infamous black seed , black caraway , black cumin , kalonji , and so forth ! it has even more purported uses than it does aliases and it is said to cure everything but death ! lol ! i use it a lot in and on bread and certain dishes for it ’ s very unique flavor , but recently i ’ ve been reading about it ’ s benefits everywhere , from the distant past to the present and am wondering how much of it is hype and how much is factual because the stuff sounds like a pharmacy ! google black seed benefits or something similar , it ’ s crazy ! i think this site is the only place i can ’ t find anything about it ! lol ! nigella sativa has been far more extensively studied than unrelated cuminum cyminum ( ordinary cumin ) , appearing in the title of 1600 + papers . most studies of n. sativa , its essential oil , or important components thymoquinone , alpha-hederin , and carvacrol have been in vitro or in animals , and many have found cancer chemoprevention , anti-tumor , antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , and indirect antioxidant effects.studies of nigella sativa in humans. most from developing nations where its long been a herbal medicine , report pluripotent effects : • relief of repiratory symptoms in asthmatics 1 , 2 and chemical war victims 3 • reduction of seizures in intractible epilepsy in two studies 4 , 5 , but not a third 6 • reducted ldl cholesterol and triglycerides 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , additive with statin therapy 11 • reduced blood pressure in hypertensives 12 , 13 , 14 • improved glycemic control 15 • topically effective against allergic rhinitis 18 and may reduce immunosuppresion from conventional therapy 19 • improved symptoms in rhumatoid arthritis 20 • relieved soreness in tonsilitis 21 • enhanced memory , attention and cognition 22 • stabilized mood in adolescents 23 • reduced opiate withdrawal symptoms 24 • improved semen quality in infertile men 25 • effective against tapeworms 26 , • comparable to triple antibiotics in eradicating h. pylori 27 • reduced hepatitis c viral load 28 and an an unusual case report , may have eliminated hiv 29several papers report contact dermatitis from n. sativa essential oil , but the the most worrysome report of toxicity is that of acute kidney failure in a hopitalized diabetic taking n. sativa tablets 30.wow darryl , thanks , that oughta keep me busy for a while ! the stuff really is amazing ! i was surprised i didn ’ t find any mention of it here prior to your helpful response , as this is always my go-to fact checking central , whenever i have a health related question . i know he can ’ t possibly cover it all , but apparently this is a pretty hot item ! nature is so amazing ! the more i learn , the more the line between food and medicine blurs , and the less pharmaceuticals seem to deserve the same term . a pharmaceutical drug ’ s focus is so singular and concentrated , which unlike the wide spectrum of complementary effects of the natural plant based herbals , seems ironically primitive by comparison ! ( isn ’ t amazing how a shift in perspective can alter your entire reality ? lol ) just have to add in my thanks – this was a great article and it is so empowering to think that we can impact the course of diseases in our bodies . makes me hopeful ! ! ! thanks , doc – you rock ! i would like to see the top ten not just the top four . i can ’ t use cloves . rosemary only in small amounts in cooking . do use ground ginger and turmeric in a tea but sometimes it seems that the system rebels . am really into anti-inflammatory herbs for osteoarthritis . would like to see more choices in any article by dr. greger because can ’ t always tolerate the specific items mentioned.dr. greger ’ s articles are mostly interesting and informative but too many times they just raise more ? ’ s that don ’ t have answers . there are a lot of answers out on the web but too much of it can ’ t be trusted.jj you might have missed it . this is the article dr greger is referencing. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23378457thank you . remember looking at it but was in a migraine aura and it wasn ’ t making sense . wonder what the difference is between paprika and cayenne ? do you think dried / ground ginger and tumeric are better or fresh ? the answer is probably … both . benefits from each . i don ’ t think you can go wrong though with the standard dried sources though . such small amounts are needed too.i use all those spices daily except rosemary . my girlfriend and i even put turmeric in our porridge.thanks doc , and thank you for your newsletters . your information makes being vegan so much more wonderful . i am learning many good things that i can share with my family and friends . keep up the good work . stay well , do good deeds and spread the love.before i start i would like to say that this site is my go to for nutrition.anyways , i didn ’ t see anything here about “ milk thistle ” . i have u. colitis and i ’ ve started using m. thistle . i found results instantly especially in my energy level . there seems to be a lot of research on it out there . i was wondering if dr. gregor could look into it . it seems to be a great liver detox ( as well as other organs ) , protects mucus membranes , stim . glutathione production.regards , robhi rob . thanks for reposting your question and glad you come here for nutrition info ! i did find some research on milk thistle and uc . it seems milk thistle may be used in uc patients to maintain remission.another one : amelioration of experimental colitis by a novel nanoselenium-silymarin mixture.hope these are helpful . i always take the stance if a herb or food can help the symptoms of a disease , so long as it does not cause additional harm , than no harm in trying.best , josephthanks dr. i found it very powerful for my condition . i felt a difference right away . but it was a little too stimulating . i decreased my intake to 1 per day or 1 every other day ( milk thistle tea ) .thanksthanks doctor . this passed week i added milk thistle and increased mushroom intake for it ’ s ergothioneine . i think with my uc ( chronic condition ) the mitochondria was being affected . my acupuncture instructor puts emphasis on the mitochondria for health so that ’ s what sparked my interest here.thanks again , robglad to hear you are finding solutions . i think acupuncture can help many ailments . quick clarification : i am registered dietitian , not a doctor ; ) thanks again for your post , robjosephdr . gonzales , do you know which anti-oxidant and / or anti-inflammatory compounds in foods cross the blood-brain barrier ? what does their ability to cross that barrier depend on ? yes , polyphenols can . check out the latest blog ( i am sure you saw it ) : - ) on berries.so is it safe if i eat a lot of these spices via gelatin capsules ? how much is too much ? thanksthose caps are so small i am not sure their impact . if worries about the gelatin can you find a veg capsule or buy spices in bulk ? i always encourage using them in food preparation rather than swallow as capsules. alternative medicine , ankylosing spondylitis , antioxidants , autoimmune diseases , cancer , cancer survival , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cayenne pepper , chicken , cholesterol , cinnamon , cloves , complementary medicine , cost savings , cumin , curcumin , dna damage , ginger , heart disease , heart failure , heart health , herbs , inflammation , inflammatory bowel disease , medications , oregano , osteoarthritis , oxidative stress , pepper , poultry , psoriasis , rosemary , side effects , spices , tumor necrosis factor , turmeric - -
52	superbugs on retail chicken one of the most concerning developments in medicine is the emergence of bacterial super-resistance — resistance not just to one class of drugs , like penicillin , but to multiple classes of drugs ( so-called multi-drug resistance ) . in the 2013 retail meat report , the fda found that more than a quarter of the salmonella contaminating retail chicken breast were resistant to not one but five or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs . throughout history there has been a continual battle between humans and pathogens . for the last half century , this battle has taken the form of bugs versus drugs . when we developed penicillin , the u.s. surgeon general declared , “ the war against infectious diseases has been won . ” however , the euphoria over the potential conquest of infectious diseases was short lived . in response to our offensive , bacteria developed an enzyme that ate penicillin for breakfast . in fact , bacteria can excrete such large quantities of the enzyme that they can destroy the drug before it even comes into contact . so we developed a drug that blocks the penicillin-eating enzyme . that ’ s why you may see two drug names on an antibiotic like augmentin — one is the actual antibiotic ( amoxicillin ) , and the other is a drug that blocks the enzyme the bacteria tries to use to block the antibiotic ( clavulanate ) . but the bacteria outsmarted us again by developing a blocker blocking blocker — and so it goes back and forth . however hard we try and however clever we are , there is no question that organisms that have “ been around for three billion years , and have adapted to survive under the most extreme conditions , will always overcome whatever we decide to throw at them . ” so we went from first generation antibiotics , to second generation antibiotics , to third generation antibiotics . we now have bacteria that have evolved the capacity to survive our big-gun third generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone , which is what we rely on to treat life-threatening salmonella infections in children . where are these super-duper-superbugs found ? according to one study profiled in my video , superbugs in conventional vs. organic chicken , “ almost 90 % were isolated from chicken carcasses or retail chicken meat . ” but what if we only ate antibiotic-free organic chicken ? in the first such study ever published , researchers compared multidrug-resistant bacteria in organic and conventional retail chicken meat . all of the conventional chicken samples were contaminated ; however , the majority ( 84 % ) of organic chicken meat samples was also contaminated . so 100 % versus 84 % . organic is definitely better , but odds are we could still be buying something that could make our family sick . where do these antibiotic resistant bacteria come from if organic producers are not using antibiotics ? a possible explanation is that day-old chicks come from the hatcheries already infected with these bacteria before they arrive at the farms . or , they could become contaminated after they leave the farm in the slaughter plant . organic chickens and conventionally raised chickens are typically all slaughtered at the same plants , so there may be cross-contamination between carcasses . finally , factory farms are dumping antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria-laden chicken manure out into the environment . researchers can pick up antibiotic-resistant genes right out of the soil around factory farms . so even meat raised without antibiotics may be contaminated with multi-drug resistant bacteria . in a cover story in which consumer reports urged retailers to stop selling meat produced with antibiotics , the researchers noted some store employee confusion : “ an assistant store manager at one grocery store , when asked by a shopper for meats raised without antibiotics , responded , ‘ wait , you mean like veggie burgers ? ’ ” on second thought maybe the employees weren ’ t so confused after all . i addressed this issue previously in videos such as : isn ’ t it illegal to sell meat contaminated with dangerous bacteria ? unfortunately no . see why in my video salmonella in chicken & turkey : deadly but not illegal . reminds me of the case i wrote about in supreme court case : meat industry sues to keep downed animals in food supply . ok . this might not be a perfect place to post this article but it is so interesting and we know what havoc antibiotics play on our gut . full article is available for free.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4245565 / great find ! veganrunner : * super * interesting article . thanks for posting it ! dr. greger , please see the jan 17th new yorker magazine cartoon on page 20 . a man is eating a hamburger & fries in a diner . a man in a white lab coat holding a clipboard sits on a nearby stool . the man , lifting his hamburger , says to the doctor / researcher : “ if it ’ s all the same to you , i ’ d rather eat this not knowing what the latest science suggests . ” i ’ d rather know . so thanks for providing the latest scientific research & education . i still think you deserve a macarthur foundation genius award because the unexamined meal might not be worth eating.thanks for the tip on the cartoon … i ’ m always looking for good ones to work into my presentations to health care professionals and lay groups . in my experience most patients are open in being exposed to knowledge but that doesn ’ t necessarily lead to change in behavior . one australian study showed that 52 % of participants had not heard of a pbd … they classified them as “ pre-contemplative ” … i see my job to move them along to the “ contemplative ” stage of change … of course an exam room or class is a different environment than a diner . the next stages for those interested are … planning , action , maintenance . the genius of this site is that it is a great commercial free way to move folks to pre-contemplation to contemplation stage . of course for those who follow the blogs and comments folks adapt change at different rates and for different reasons . keep tuned and thanks again for the tip.hi don , please provide a link to the study . thanks.its funny that time scale of 3 billion years gets mentioned . that is actually not the sort of time that is the big factor.bacteria live on a different time scale from us . they splice of at rates of 20 min to a few hours , and every split might have the mutation that proves protective . they pack up to half a million generations in 1 of ours.in human relativity that would mean 12,5 million years to adapt to that nasty new medicine or chemical . if anything bacteria are very poor adapters if one looks at it like that.i mean look at what we did in half that time : http : / / i29.photobucket.com / albums / c294 / aarongabriel1 / brains _ large.jpgwhen everyone is eating more and more meat … shall soon die out the chimpanzeemy gut flora was a mess after taking a cephalosporin . research on probiotics is weak and biased . i ended up eating lots of raw vegetables , and fermented cabbage . three days later , my gas and discomfort after eating my favorite foods ( legumes ) was gone.as a vegan i have no real concern about getting a super bug from chicken , or any other meat . however the fact that these super bugs are loose and free to roam , they obviously pose a serious heath threat to everyone . i ’ ve been a fan of using nutrition and natural treatment as opposed to drugs for many years.the day may arrive , and sooner than we might expect , when a plague created by some mutated virus will sweep across the world , entirely resistant to any treatment . on those who actually can fight this off , without medical intervention will survive long enough to reproduce and carry on the species.these are the folks , who , like the very adaptable super bacteria mentioned , evolved some natural means of fighting off viral infection . first principles at work , only the strong shall survive.bacteria are everywhere not only in chicken but just everywhere ( any food , water , air etc . ) . and the only real thing that can protect us is our immunity however banal it may sounds . so we again should go to the basics : nutrition , sleep , physical activities and stress managment . i doubt there ever will be a better way.evolutionarily , is there any benefit for bacteria to kill its host ? not really , apart from the fact that they can spread out from the body and infect other hosts ( but they already do that following other ways ) .the “ best ” parasite is the one that is symptom free for the host.how can we find independent farmers to buy live chickens from n our area . we need to get organic natural raised chicken . other countries sell live chickens at farmers markets . why cant we do the same here ? boycott the big producers . until they raise chickens the natural way instead of cage raised . either that or get laws n place to outlaw cage raised animals . its cruel and animal abuse . they are not fit for human consumption anyway . we have those two choices.chicken would be a bad idea even if “ organic ” .check the videos here : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / chicken / and yikes , living chicken to be killed at home .. ? no matter how you would put it , the whole thing is animal cruelty , and for not good reason , the only thing you get from eating them , is to be a lot more prone to disease , and contributing directly to arteriosclerosis.broilers and broiler meat products are highly contaminated with multiresistent escherichia coli and are considered to be a source for human infections . both transmission from bird to bird and transmission from bird to offspring might play a role in the presence of these strains in broilers . the percentage of infected birds at dutch broiler farms increased within the first week from 0 – 24 % to 96 – 100 % independent of the use of antibiotics and stayed 100 % until slaughter.much of the global broiler chicken population is hatched and processed in as few as six weeks , dramatically multiplying the annual number of new potential zoonotic hosts . every year 45 billion chickens pass through the world , along with 1 billion pigs , which may have contact with an estimated 50 billion great reservoir of waterfowl , like ducks , geese and swans . never before has the avian influenza a virus had so many potential “ stepping stones ” from which to choose.broiler chickens have been selectively bred for rapid growth to market weight . in 1920 , a chicken reached 1 kg in 16 weeks , but today ’ s broiler chicken strains may now reach 2.6 kg , a size large enough for slaughter , in only 6 weeks . daily growth rates have increased from 25 g to 100 g in the past 50 years — an increase of more than 300 % . genetic selection is so intense that the age by which broiler chickens reach market weight and are slaughtered has decreased by as much as one day every year . ongoing selection for rapid growth is a severe welfare problem as it has resulted in poor bone health , leg disorders including deformities , lameness , tibial dyschondroplasia ( td ) , and ruptured tendons , and has been correlated with metabolic disorders such as ascites and sudden death syndrome . heavier broilers ( > 2400 g ) are more likely to be lame . in some cases birds become completely unable to walk.an interesting side note to this article : i helped lead a systematic literature review ( currently writing manuscript for publication ) to determine the connection between antibiotic use on farms to the emerging resistant bacteria found in humans . one finding in our search was that although organic chicken had nearly as much bacteria , conventional chicken had more resistant bacteria . there are also so many factors at play with the spread of resistant bacteria – unfortunately , its not as simple as completely eliminating the use of antibiotics from all farms . hopefully , with the president ’ s new plan to combat resistance ( http : / / www.whitehouse.gov / the-press-office / 2015 / 01 / 27 / fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a ) , we will start to have better tracking systems where we can follow super-bug sickness in the hospital all the way back to its original source ( food , farm animal , pet , wildlife , etc ) . then we can make a more definitive conclusion as to how resistant bacteria is emerging and spreading , and what we can do to control it. antibiotics , beef , chicken , children , consumers union , factory farming practices , farm animals , fda , fecal contamination , food poisoning , foodborne illness , meat , medications , organic foods , penicillin , pork , poultry , salmonella , superbugs , turkey , veggie burgers - -
53	foods for computer eye strain what happens to our eyesight when we sit in front of a computer all day ? as researchers from the suny college of optometry note in a study profiled in my video , dietary treatments for computer eye strain , the rise in computer screens “ has led to an increase in ocular and visual problems , including eye discomfort , blurring of distant objects , eye strain , and asthenopia ( visual fatigue ) . ” this has caused so-called “ nearwork-induced transient myopia . ” that ’ s when after staring at a computer screen for a while we look out the window and things start out all blurry . our vision becomes blurred because our poor little ciliary muscles pulling at our lens are locked in this constant state of contraction to keep that near focus . over time , this may have long-term adverse consequences . how to combat computer eye strain experts in the field recommend taking 4-12 minute breaks staring out the window every hour . we can also aid our vision with our diet . a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study , for example , found a significant improvement in refractive values and eyestrain symptoms when subjects ate black currants compared to a placebo . however , what passes for currants in the u.s. are usually champagne grape raisins , not actual black currants , which were banned in the u.s. a century ago at the behest of the lumber industry . the lumber industry feared that they might spread a plant disease that affects white pine ( which we hardly even harvest any more ) . black currants are , however , currently making a comeback ( and the ban has been lifted in some states ) , though any anthocyanin-rich berry might have similar benefits ( such as bilberries , blueberries , cranberries , black raspberries and red raspberries ) . foods vs. supplements why bother with whole bilberries or black currants when we could just take anthocyanin supplements ? because , as we ’ ve seen over and over again , when we test supplements , we ’ re lucky if they actually contain what is listed on the label . furthermore , even for products containing bilberries , one study found that labeling was often uninformative , misleading , or both , something for which the herbal supplement market is infamous . the largest study to date found that it appears most herbal supplement labels lie . bilberries vs. nazis bilberries gained notoriety during world war ii when it was said that pilots in the british royal air force “ were eating bilberry jam to improve their night vision . ” it turns out this may have been a story concocted to fool the germans . the real reason the brits were able to suddenly target nazi bombers in the middle of the night before the bombers even made it to the english channel was likely not because of bilberries , but because of a top secret new invention the british needed to keep quiet : radar . for best results when it comes to computer eye strain , stick to whole berries with blue and red pigments , and don ’ t forget to give your eyes a break each hour . for other videos on protecting our vision , check out greens vs. glaucoma , where i listed the best foods to help prevent glaucoma ; in dietary prevention of age-related macular degeneration i did the same for age-related macular degeneration . i ’ ve also addressed the dietary treatment of glaucoma . by using a standing or treadmill desk , we can avoid some of the other adverse health effects of sitting at a computer all day . see my video standing up for your health . i ’ m now up to 17 miles a day ! bpa-alternative turning out to be maybe even worse than bpa : in a groundbreaking study , researchers have shown why a chemical once thought to be a safe alternative to bisphenol-a , which was abandoned by manufacturers of baby bottles and sippy cups after a public outcry , might itself be more harmful than bpa.http : / / www.washingtonpost.com / national / health-science / bpa-alternative-disrupts-normal-brain-cell-growth-is-tied-to-hyperactivity-study-says / 2015 / 01 / 12 / a9ecc37e-9a7e-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4 _ story.htmlwhat idiots they are : ( i also recommend a program called ” f.lux ” to reduce eyestrain . just enter your location and it does the rest.i think that working as an operator and later in the business office at the phone company froze my muscles . now retired i cured myself by reading “ the program for better vision ” doing the exercises . i no longer need classes for distance or close up . so the muscles can be reactivated . mine did so after wearing glasses for 42 years.i do need to improve my typing skills ! it is glasses not classes ! lola bigger monitor / screen placed further away should be a consideration also.good reminder , thanks ! i had to look twice to parse the “ 4-12 minute breaks … every hour ” reference . if i took 4 12 minutes breaks each hour , i would get very little else done . might be worth spelling it out ( “ to ” ) in this instance , for easily confused folks like me . : di can only speak for myself , but i am attempting to reverse my own myopia . as mentioned in the blog post , breaks are critical , but there is animal model evidence to suggest that our eyes are physically adapting to corrective lenses . ever wonder why we need stronger prescriptions every year ? our lenses have a fixed focus point that is individually tuned so our eyes can focus at infinite distance . these lenses are not appropriate for close up work that happens around 16-24 ″ and may ultimately damage our vision even further.i now do all close up work with a greatly reduced prescription . the strength is chosen such that my screens are crisp but everything just beyond them begins to blur . like lifting weights in the gym , this should encourage my eyes to respond by increasing their range of focus over time . as with anything else involving our biology , our eyes are constantly adapting to environmental stresses . at least that ’ s the theory i ’ m betting on . i continue to use my full-strength prescription when outdoors or when doing anything that requires perfect vision at a distance such as driving . i haven ’ t seen much improvement in my range of focus yet ( only 5 weeks in ) but my eyes are no longer red at the end of the day , and they feel much more comfortable in general.i wish there was more human data available to guide us , but the rapidly growing eyewear industry has no incentive to fund such research . any eye doctor to suggest such practices would be ostracized by their peers who have been trained to prescribe as many lenses as possible . i ’ m sure dr. greger knows what that feels like . it ’ s a testament to his dedication to the truth , and us . this is no different than any other area of the modern medical industry . prevention and reversal of disease , myopia in this case , is outside of the existing paradigm and threatens industry profits , much like our beloved whole food plant-based diet.you are not alone , i am actually doing the same thing – wearing reduced strength lenses for daily tasks and only putting on the “ correct ” glasses for driving at night . i am also trying to encourage ( or “ retrain ” ) my eyes to focus , as that ’ s the ability they lose with time when assisted by stronger lenses . i ’ ve been doing that for over a year now . sadly , my daily schedule is still wrong , i.e. not enough sleep and not enough eye exercises , but i notice improvement in focusing , sometimes i can see really well with my weak glasses , but only sometimes . i am sure combined with eating lots of berries and green leafy veggies , plus less computer time , more time in the sun and outdoors , as well as some eye exercises would make it possible to reverse myopia , especially in the 50 ’ s + .based on limited individual cases , i think it will continue to add up over time . i ’ m doing most of those things too , including indirect exposure to sunlight by wearing hats without sunglasses when possible . awesome to hear that i ’ m not alone.definitely not alone : ) btw i am not in the 50 ’ s , much younger , but my guess is that generally myopia naturally stops progressing after the 20 ’ s and starts reversing as one gets older . but wearing stronger and stronger lenses every year should be a huge alarm bell – it is just plain wrong and makes no sense . i encourage everyone to get eye prescription and glasses , but also order glasses with reduced lenses from one of the cheap online stores , you can reduce strength by 0.5 or 1.0 and try them out for some time . these days a pair of glasses can be ordered for as cheap as $ 9 , so why not ? jack , i ’ m following the same path as you and james . i ’ m myopic and my distance vision has definitely improved , and my “ driving glasses ” prescription is much weaker than before.i think the fruit and veg help , but it was this website that got me on my way : http : / / www.myopia.org / if you click on the picture of the young girl at the right of the page it brings you to an animation that explains the principle.you skipped over the most obvious and highest quality solution of all – forget commercial retail “ supplements . ” the phytomedicines ( plant powders put inside a capsule ) are typically several years since harvest ; they are encapsualized often in smaller size gelatin caps which many people have a difficult time digesting at the doses which would garner a body response from that phytochemical ; and you are always going to be more prone to getting contamination from other excipients , fillers , extenders , fakes , etc . so , why not try learning how to grow what you can , but until you can be your own producer , research and purchase in bulk size , the raw material which the supplement companies purchase to use in their “ manufacturing ” process . it might take a few months , but you can vet the quality suppliers and can set up a first-rate apothecary comprised of infinitely more flexible , customizable , much higher quality , and did i mention incredibly more cost-effective ? for example , if you put in a bilberry shrub this year , and until it produces , you buy a pound of bilberry berry powder from a reputable source such as mountain rose herbs , and use in smoothies or capsulize it yourself ( in high quality veggie-caps ) , you can experience its many benefits right now from the fantastic power of bilberry – which is similar looking to the more common blueberry but with exponentially higher levels of medicine — the cost-effective question alone sells the idea of becoming your own herbal medicine self-healer . why take decades and go broke trying to get the medicine from what is essentially a much weaker carrier – the blueberry ? i use blueberries as flavoring but i use the far more powerful berries in organic powder form , as my medicines and in numerous ways . the lesser known berries , roots , leaves , barks , and flowers which have a much longer proven track record than the recent known to be harmful and unproven commercially synthesized pharmaceuticals , can be used in both food dishes and as medicine teas , caps , poultices , essential oils . many more knowledgeable researchers say the difference between earlier man and us is that they used to use these lesser known roots , berries , flowers , leaves as daily food and this is why many of us are trying to return to these habits through herbal medicine . herbal medicine was once simply our daily hunter-gatherer diet . modern agricultural genetics has dumbed down the wisdom of plants.does anybody get headaches from working at the computer ?

54	currant treatment for glaucoma in my video , dietary prevention for age-related macular degeneration , i discussed how eating goji berries with nuts and seeds can help build up yellow plant pigments such as lutein and zeaxanthin in our eyes to help fight age-related macular degeneration . but once we ’ ve preserved the pigment in our retinal pigment epithelial cells , we need to keep them alive . this may be where anthocyanin phytonutrients come in . anthocyanins ( from the greek anthos , meaning flower , and kyanos , meaning blue ) are natural plant pigments that make pansies look purple and turn green cabbage into purple cabbage , yellow corn into purple corn , brown rice to purple rice , white potatoes to blue potatoes , orange carrots to purple carrots , and keeps blueberries blue and blackberries black . as we age , our critical retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) layer starts to break down . however , we may be able to decelerate that aging with blueberries . in the study i profile in my video , dietary treatment of glaucoma , human rpe cells bathed in blueberry anthocyanins had fewer free radicals and a lower proportion of aged cells , suggesting that blueberries and other red , blue , and purple pigmented fruits and vegetables may help prevent age-related macular degeneration . blueberries may be especially important for blue eyes , as can be seen in my video greens vs. glaucoma . preventing disease is nice , but what if we already have a disease like glaucoma , an incurable eye disease in which our optic nerve ( which connects our eyes to our brain ) starts deteriorating , and we start losing our visual fields ? a few years ago , japanese researchers showed they could apparently halt the progression of glaucoma with black currants . they gave people black currants for six months and found that black currants significantly boosted the blood flow to their optic nerve . the results suggest that black currants might be a safe and valuable option , but because the study was not double-blind and there was no control group , i didn ’ t report on it when it was initially published . but now we ’ ve got just such a study . glaucoma patients were split into two groups — half got black currants ; the other half didn ’ t . the study measured the deterioration of the patients ’ visual fields in both groups in the two years leading up to the study . despite taking the best glaucoma drugs on the market , the subjects ’ visual fields deteriorated . then the study starts . the berry-free control group continued to worsen , but the berries appeared to stop the disease in its tracks after both one and two years . and since there ’ s no downside to berries ( only good side-effects ) , in my professional opinion everyone with glaucoma should be eating berries every day . for more on the latest science on preventing and treating vision loss , check out greens vs. glaucoma , where i detailed the best foods to help prevent glaucoma . my previous treatment of glaucoma can be found here : prevent glaucoma and see 27 miles farther . i ’ ve mentioned anthocyanins before in : they may be why purple potatoes ( anti-inflammatory effects of purple potatoes ) and purple cabbage ( superfood bargains ) may be preferable . anthocyanins are the pigments in red and purple cabbage that allow for the kitchen chemistry in testing your diet with pee & purple cabbage . more on currants in enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation . do people with beeturia excrete all those beneficial anthocyanin ? i have beeturia but never excrete any pretty colors when i consume black currant.dr. gregor , are these fresh or dried black currants used in the study ? not sure i ’ ve ever seen them at my grocer.would black current oil have any benefits ?

have you ever seen any articles published on this ? i have done medline searches and haven ’ t found anything.most people don ’ t have to a problem with solanine . don ’ t flame the nightshade concern . i personally consume lots of nightshades without a problem . if you feel you have a problem with nightshades , go get tested for the allergy.i remember the american academy of dietetics published their review of nightshade plants and found that they were not harmful . same thing with the blood type diet , it was not credible . they were positive about vegetarian and vegan diets , with some cautions ( like ensuring people get adequate calcium , iron and zinc ) . they are now called the academy of nutrition and dietetics.you write primarily about dark berries , primarily black currants but then in the last sentence you say everyone with glaucoma should be eating berries every day . are lighter berries also beneficial for glaucoma ? i ’ ve been trying to sample different varieties of black currants when i get the chance and i haven ’ t found a variety that i really like yet . i prefer red currants and other dark berries like blueberries and marionberries . can you advise on specific varieties so i know which to grow ? the berries used in the study are known as cassis and are not the currants grown in the us , according to other videos on this website . st. dalfour is a french company that manufactures preserves and has a cassis preserve that i use as a spread . in japan , we have a cassis extract ( supplement ) containing the anthocyanins . it is expensive , but i am willing to use it as a treatment . nutritional support is popular here due to numerous commercial applications regularly researched by japanese scientists ( as these two cited studies attest ) . i also use drops for glaucoma , however , i am optimistic that the addition of these berries can help maximize visual acuity.fresh and frozen only ! or dried ok ? and are other berries as helpful , or is it something special in currants ? thnk you dr g , you rock ! ok i see now there is a special dr3 variety of anthocyanins in currnts , given they took them in tablet form , i assume dried currants are ok . or buy tablets … the principle is simple : the darker the berry the more beneficial pigment it contains.then the black elderberries i consume are now extra special.ok i see now there is a special dr3 variety of anthocyanins in currnts , nd given they took them in tablet form , i assume dried currants are ok . or buy tablets … almost always , the whole food is more healthful than a tablet.the small dried fruits sold as “ currants ” are actually dried very small grapes – zante currents , used for baking . the black currant used here is a genus ribes species , related to blueberries , not grapes . it ’ s really dark and tiny . i was surprised to see a study using them since i ’ ve never seen them commercialy available . in the uk they ’ re a traditional source of vitamin c for children – a sweet fruit concentrate called “ ribena ” they ’ re very strong flavored and most people need to cultivate a taste for them.these look like they might be the real thing : http : / / www.currantc.com / index.php ? submenu = about _ us & src = gendocs & ref = currantc _ story & category = v4 _ about _ usyup . those are black currants . that ’ s a nice website . i ’ m amazed at the acreageof currant bushes in the photo . i have a mere 3 bushes and they take days to pick – very very labor intensive picking . their fruit price is a bargain ! i ’ m thinking for those who live in apartments , they may be able to find black currents in polish / russian specialty food stores or in jams or jellies . not exactly the healthiest option , though . if i recall , the fresh berries are extremely tart . best for juicing with added source of sweetener ( fresh apple juice that you make yourself , for example or from a trusted brand ( knudsen ? ) ) .ribena got into legal troubles because of their vitamin c claims . they were fined. http : / / metro.co.uk / 2007 / 03 / 26 / ribena-has-almost-no-vitamin-c-204616 / the stuff they sell on my supermarket shelves has additives , so i wouldn ’ t call it a fresh product or a whole food.o fresh red or black grapes give the same protection as currents ? roy , almost certainly not ; as another post says , the currants being discussed are not related to grapes or zante ‘ currants ’ which are raisins . the genus ribes ( red or black currants ) is the sole member of a family ( grossulariaceae ) closest to the saxifrage family , not as elsewhere stated bluberries ( which are heath family members ) . so unless the resveratrol in grapes does something similar , grapes ( in its own family ) won ’ t help.dr. greger why don ’ t you include in your articles how much was given of any foods you tell about ? and how did they get people to eat the black currants when they are not very tasty ? details are just as important as research results when it come to using a food for a health problem . thank you.this study dealt with normal tension glaucoma only . my assumption is is that those of us with glaucoma who have ocular hypertension as the cause would therefore not benefit from the methods this study used . or at least that would hold true until further research confirms that ocular hypertension glaucoma is also improved with the study ’ s treatment methods.i ’ ve never seen fresh black currants in any store in the us . when i can ’ t find a fresh produce , my second choice is freeze-dried powder , but i can ’ t find freeze-dried black currant powder at amazon or any other health-food online store i shop at . i did find the french black currant jam another reader had mentioned , but it ’ s sweetened with fruit juice , which is like sweetening with sugar water , so i ’ d like to avoid it . any ideas about consuming black currant regularly is appreciated . thanksthomasn : i know someone who gets frozen black currents ( at least i think it is the right kind that we are talking about here ) on-line . the shipping is very expensive since they ship with dried ice to keep it frozen . but it might be worth getting ? ? ? ? do you want me to try to find the supplier ? znaturalfoods.com has freeze dried for 30 per lb . also has excellent products , i have ordered many and am always happyhere ’ s a paper that lists the anthocyanin content of some common foods : j. agric . food chem . 2006 , 54 , 4069 − 4075 ( available online free of charge ; i tried to upload it without success . ) thanks , thomasn ; i see from that wu et al paper that black currants are highest in delphinidin and cyanidin . so my reply to roy should be modified – though red grapes won ’ t help , concord grapes have similar though much lower anthocyanin content.i have been conscientiously eating roughly two tablespoons of black currants daily — a bit of overkill from darryll ’ s calculations of 1 1 / 3 tablespoons of black currants daily — to get the adequate amount of anthocyanin to protect against the deleterious effects of glaucoma . if i were to switch to blue berries , could i give up the black currants ? shipping costs to the west coast for the black currants are astronomical . or could i lessen my costs by eating some blue berries and fewer black currants ? if i could switch to blue berries — either totally or partially , what quantity a day would i need to consume ?

57	how long to avoid fish before conception ? mothers ’ increased consumption of fish before and during pregnancy leads to increased exposure to both mercury and the long-chain omega 3 dha . mercury may negatively affect brain development in one ’ s unborn baby , whereas dha may stimulate brain development . however , the negative effect of mercury appears to outweigh the beneficial effect of dha for most species of fish ( see mercury vs. omega-3s for brain development ) . unfortunately , women of childbearing age appear less aware and knowledgeable about this problem than other women , despite fda and epa campaigns to inform every ob / gyn and pediatrician in the country about the potential risks of mercury in fish . since mercury sticks around in the body , women may want to avoid fish with high levels of mercury for a year before they get pregnant , not just during pregnancy . the rationale for avoiding fish for a year before pregnancy is because the half-life of mercury in the body is estimated to be about two months . in a study i profile in my video how long to detox from fish before pregnancy a group of researchers fed subjects two servings a week of tuna and other high mercury fish to push their mercury levels up , and then stopped the fish . slowly but surely their levels came back down ( see the video for the graph ) . i know a lot of moms are concerned about exposing their children to mercury containing vaccines , but if they eat even just a serving a week of fish during pregnancy , the latest data shows that their infants end up with substantially more mercury in their bodies than if they were injected with up to six mercury-containing vaccines . given the two-month half-life of mercury , within a year of stopping fish consumption our bodies can detox nearly 99 % of the mercury . unfortunately the other industrial pollutants in fish can take longer for our body to get rid of . certain dioxins , pcbs , and ddt metabolites found in fish have a half-life as long as ten years . so getting that same 99 % drop could take 120 years , which is a long time to delay one ’ s first child . the fact that we can still find ddt in umbilical cord blood decades after the pesticide was banned speaks to the persistence of some pollutants . there ’ s a shortcut for moms , but it ’ s the wrong way to detox . what effects do these other pollutants have ? well , high concentrations of industrial contaminants are associated with 38 times the odds of diabetes — that ’ s as strong as the relationship between smoking and lung cancer ! isn ’ t diabetes mostly associated with obesity though ? well , these pollutants are fat-soluble , so “ as people get fatter the retention and toxicity of persistent organic pollutants related to the risk of diabetes may increase . ” this suggests the shocking possibility that obesity “ may only be a vehicle ” for such chemicals . now the pollutants could just be a marker for animal product consumption , which may be why there ’ s such higher diabetes risk , since more than 90 % of the persistent organic pollutants comes from animal foods . and indeed , in the u.s. every additional serving of fish a week is associated with a 5 % increased risk of diabetes , which makes fish consumption about 80 % worse than red meat . pcbs are found most concentrated in fish and eggs ( food sources of pcb chemical pollutants ) , which may be why there are lower levels of industrial pollutants in vegans . this may also help explain the remarkable findings in eggs and diabetes . more on the risks of mercury can be found in these videos : dr greger- you are the best ! i just gave a donation to help with your costs and i hope others will too ! this information is so important and yet so sorely missing from most doctors and healthcare professionals . i really appreciate the work you and your team do for all of us who care about our health . veganmom4girlsdr . greger , thanks for the work you do . how would you account for the fact that paleo folks ( chris kresser comes to mind ) can trot out data that supports their view , so diametrically opposed to the vegan view ?

58	boosting anti-cancer immunity with berries for disease prevention and health maintenance , berries of all colors have “ emerged as champions . ” research has focused mainly on cancer prevention and treatment . studies show that the anticancer effects of berries are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract , reduce , and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation . berries may also have many other positive effects , such as boosting detoxifying enzymes . one of the more remarkable effects is that of blueberries on natural killer cell counts . natural killer cells are part of our immune system ’ s rapid response team against cancer cells , eliminating cancer cells through the activation of cancer cell suicide via death receptors . they ’ re called natural killers because they don ’ t require activation by prior exposure . we don ’ t want to wait until our second tumor before our immune system starts fighting . we have about two billion of these soldiers circulating in our blood stream at any one time , but we may be able to get a troop surge with blueberries . researchers had athletes eat about a cup and a half of blueberries a day for six weeks to see if that would reduce the oxidative stress of long-distance running . they indeed saw a blunting of the spike in oxidant stress . but that ’ s not what sets that study apart . the number of natural killer cells in the blood typically decreases after prolonged endurance exercise , dropping by half to only about one billion — that is , unless we ’ ve been eating lots of blueberries . in the video , boosting natural killer cell activity , you can see a graph comparing natural killer cell numbers with and without blueberries . those who ate blueberries retained close to the standard two billion cells . this is because six weeks of blueberries had doubled the resting number of natural killer cells up to over four billion . this has never before been demonstrated in humans . there was a study on goji berries , but despite a cup a day for a month , there was no significant change in the number of natural killers . another study , though , showed a significant increase in natural killer cell activity thanks to the spice cardamom . ( cardamom and blueberries — i never thought we ’ d be fighting cancer with blueberry muffins ! ) when researchers took some lymphoma cells in a petri dish and added cardamom , nothing happened . however , if we add some natural killer cells , about 5 % of the cancer cells are wiped out . add a little more cardamom , and our troops do better still . and then if we add more and more spice , then all of a sudden the natural killer cells are killing cancer like crazy — the same number of natural killer cells , but they ’ re now able to kill off ten times more cancer cells . while cardamom alone had no effect on cancer cells even at the highest dose , it seemed to enhance our natural killer cells ’ killer instincts . the same thing was found for black pepper : black pepper alone , nothing , but when combined with natural killer cells , there seemed to be a boosting effect up to around 30 or 40 % cancer cell clearance . if cardamom and black pepper are combined , they synergize and their individual effects are doubled . the researchers conclude that “ taken together , these data strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom have the potential to markedly enhance the anti-cancer activity of natural killer cells . ” exercise itself can improve immune function in general ( see preserving immune function in athletes with nutritional yeast ) , but the blueberry finding , so far , is unique . the oxidative stress part of the story is told in reducing muscle soreness with berries . it is true that the blueberry study was funded by the north american blueberry council and the north carolina high-bush blueberry council . however , just because the study was funded by blueberry councils doesn ’ t necessarily mean the science is suspect , but we would want to see the study independently verified , especially one so dramatic . what else can berries do ? check out : you can check also out my blueberry smoothie recipe here in a better breakfast . would frozen berries have the same benefits ? yes , frozen blueberries retain their antioxidants.thanks ! can we know if the active element of cardamom gets into the bloodstream ? how much blueberries would need to be consumed to have these effects . i think it ’ s premature to emphasize the benefits if quantity of blueberry consumption is unrealisticdr . greger recommends one cup a day and the book “ super foods , fourteen foods that will change your life < " by steven pratt and kathy matthews recommends one to two cups a day . raisins and dried fruit do count . juice is evidently too filtered and canning damages the phytonutrients . eating this many berries can make your brain two years younger . this amount of berries could be expensive , as alluded to by ariel , and not always available , so considered dried. http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b00eqa93oy / ref = od _ aui _ detailpages01 ? ie = utf8 & psc = 1cardamom and black pepper … that ’ s in the recipe for chai tea !

too long . berries you can grow , purchase , or wild-harvest , which you might want to begin learning about and experimenting with include : hawthorn , elder , marqui , acerola , schisandra , saw palmetto , bilberry , sea buckthorn , gogi , aronia , camu camu , amla , lingonberry , yumberry . the list is huge as to what you and i can locate and safely purchase , grow in our yard , wild-harvest on a nature walk , and then learn to incorporate into our daily diet . the potential impact of these lesser known berries far outweigh the importance of remembering to budget and buy blueberries . when you get around to comparing the phytonutrient content of the marginalized or forgotten but readily available more medicinal berries , you can prove to your self that the habit you wish to cultivate is researching what is not being sold to you every time you log on to the internet to read another re-hashed story about blueberries or the other so-called superfruit . berries as a category is so much more than the big three – blueberries , strawberries , black / raspberries and it it time to bring the lesser promoted ones into the light . in the end , it is simply one of cost-effectiveness . the rest of this century will be about cost-effective eating … .eating for longevity and prevention means we need to ask the question of roi.you have done great research to condense so long a list of super berries ! i was using the list of berries from the republic of tea for that , acai , pomegrante , goji , cherry acerola , blueberry , black raspberry , and sea buckthorn . your list will help a lot of people . dr. greger has some videos on this topic : links at this link : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eating-healthy-on-a-budget / eating healthy on a budget eating healthy on the cheap biggest nutrition bang for your buck cheapest source of vitamin b12 the effect of canned tuna on future wages are goji berries good for you ?

59	the vitamin everyone on a plant-based diet needs a new study from china found that compared to omnivores , those who ate egg-free and meat-free diets had all the typical benefits of eating more plant-based : lower body mass index , lower blood pressure , lower triglyceride , lower total cholesterol , lower bad cholesterol , less free radical damage , etc . having said that , if those on plant-based diets don ’ t get enough vitamin b12 , levels of an artery-damaging compound called homocysteine can start to rise in the bloodstream and may counteract some of the benefits of healthy eating . in a study profiled in my video , vitamin b12 necessary for arterial health , a group of taiwanese researchers found that the arteries of vegetarians were just as stiff as the omnivores and both had the same level of thickening in their carotid arteries , presumably because of the elevated homocysteine levels . the researchers concluded : “ the negative findings of these studies should not be considered as evidence of neutral cardiovascular effects of vegetarianism , but do indicate an urgent need for modification of vegan diets through vitamin b12 fortification or supplementation . vitamin b12 deficiency is a very serious problem leading ultimately to anemia , neuropsychiatric disorders , irreversible nerve damage , and high levels of artery-damaging homocysteine in the blood . prudent vegans should include sources of vitamin b12 in their diets . ” one study of vegetarians whose b12 levels were really hurting found that they had even thicker , more dysfunctional arteries than omnivores . how do we know b12 was to blame ? because once they were given b12 supplements they got better . their arterial lining started to shrink back , and the proper functioning of their arteries returned . without b12 fortified foods or b12 supplements , omnivores who were switched to a vegan diet developed vitamin b12 deficiency . yes , it may take our blood levels dropping down to around 150 picomoles per liter to develop classic signs of b12 deficiency , like anemia or spinal cord degeneration , but way before that , we may start getting increased risk of cognitive deficits and brain shrinkage , stroke , depression , and nerve and bone damage . the rise in homocysteine may attenuate the beneficial effects of a vegetarian diet on cardiovascular health . the researchers concluded that while the beneficial effects of vegetarian diets on cholesterol and blood sugars “ need to be advocated , but at the same time efforts to correct vitamin b12 deficiency in vegetarian diets can never be overestimated . ” i ’ ve watched all of your videos on b12 , and read everything posted on this website that pertains to b12 , but do not see any mention by you discussing the possibility that b12 supplements do not work for some people due to genetic issues / defects , and therefore a need to do the “ mthfr test ” or other related genetic tests to find out why the body is not benefiting from b12 , and why these supplements might be causing them bad reactions as well . i do not understand the science of this genetic issue , but i know for me that b12 supplements cause severe adverse reactions in me , all forms , all injections , those without sweeteners , with sweeteners , with dairy , without dairy , different doses , – you name it , b12 supplements make me feel way worse than without.and i know of plenty of others who have great difficulty with b12 supplements as well , and have said that it is a “ genetic issue ” that must be addressed . dr. greger , do you have any knowledge of this mthfr issue , and / or science related to that will help those who have issues with b12 supplements ? i want to be 100 vegan , and know of plenty of others who do as well , but they have not been able to find the missing link to why b12 pills are not working , and / or causing them bad reactions.individuals bearing some very common mthfr polymorphisms ( eg c677t or a1298c ) don ’ t have impaired b12 metabolism . instead , they have up to 70 % less activity of mthfr , an enzyme in the folate cycle required to reduce methylene-thf to methyl-thf . in the methionine cycle , the methyl is transfered from methyl-thf to homocysteine , to reform methionine by an enzyme which uses b12 as a cofactor . here ’ s showing how the two cycles relate.relate.in practical terms , this means individuals with mthfr mutations may need consume more biologically active folate to compensate . natural folate is ubiquitous in plant foods , especially green leafy vegetables , legumes , and the germ of grains . however , it isn ’ t shelf-stable , so synthetic folic acid is used in supplements and to fortify processed foods like flour and breakfast cereals . humans have a limited and variable capacity to convert folic acid to active folate , and some take supplements of a shelf-stable form of biologically active folate ( levomefolic acid , tradmarked metafolin and deplin ) , which is more bioavailable than folic acid . the amount of levomefolic acid in supplements ( 400-1000 μg ) is comparable to the amount of folate in whole plant based diets , and those eating a lot of leafy green vegetables and greens can do significantly better.thanks for this . am i understanding this correctly that individuals with this mthfr polymorphism issue are not processing the methionine correctly / efficiently and are therefore ending up having it remain as homocysteine ( not getting converted back to methionine ) , thus , they end up testing very high in serum homocysteine ? right . with impaired mthfr activity , the folates build up as methylene-thf , and only the amount that eeks through mthfr to methyl-thf are available to remethylate homocysteine back into methionine.i should add that there ’ s good reason to suspect that the association of elevated homocysteine with cardiovascular disease is a coincident marker of too much high-methionine animal protein and not enough folate containing greens in the diet . genetic predispositions to lifelong moderately higher homocysteine ( like the c677t or a1298c polymorphisms ) have little or no effect on cardiovascular risk . homocysteine lowering interventions , including folic acid supplementation , have no significant impact on cvd risk . in animal studies , high methionine intake increases homocysteine , but is also sufficient to increase atherosclerosis even in the absence of elevated homocysteine . a study of the common mthfr c677t polymorphism , which lowers levels of methyl-thf and elevates homocysteine , suggests that the homocysteine may just be a marker of low methyl-thf status , which has a more direct role in atherosclerosis . folate has a lot of cardiovascular benefits apart from remethylating homocysteine , perhaps mediated by quenching the peroxynitrite-derived radicals which cause ischemia / reperfusion injury . the title of this review almost says it all . i would have used “ how does folate cure heart attacks ” .interesting and just a tad over my head , but i do get the gist . however , i don ’ t understand why elsie ’ s issues with folic acid would cause the shellfish to mitigate her symptoms.for now i am guessing that the b12 in the shellfish is being absorbed by my body and utilized effectively , and for whatever reason b12 supplement / injections are not . maybe my ( and others ’ ) inability to benefit from b12 supplements has nothing to do with the mthfr / folate issue ? interestingly , my serum folate level is great.what role does b12 play in this , and why do people feel this ( mthfr issue ) is why they have an issue with being able to digest , absorb , utilize , etc. different forms ( or any ) of b12 ? the way it was explained to me by my doctor was that “ b12 is a necessary component to allow for many different and multi-layered reactions in the body , and some of these reactions are not even the ones we commonly talk about . ” i ’ m guessing from what you ’ ve said already , a humans ability to absorb / digest / fully utilize a b12 supplement has nothing to do with having this mthfr issue ? darryl : thank you for answering this question . i know someone who was asking me this very question the other day . now i have much better information for her . so , you have already helped more than one person . thanks ! just want to say i very much appreciate your detailed replies.elsie , i ’ m wondering if your level of healthy gut bacteria is not enough to allow for b12 to get into the bloodstream . i recall one person who had to eat animal foods to get his b12 levels up . when i worked with him to reduce his consumption of meat , i recommended probiotics supplementation at double the usual dosage for 2 months . it did the trick , and his b12 levels were very good . he has it checked every 6 months , and if b12 is dropping , he does another round of probiotics . i generally recommend the human micro flora type of probiotic , not the bovine type . to be vegan , take it in powdered form , just mix it into smoothies , cold drinks , water , etc . you need to keep it refrigerated.to understand why i think it could be an issue of healthy bacteria levels in the gut , here ’ s a link to an article that may help : http : / / www.prevention.com / food / healthy-eating-tips / how-probiotics-and-prebiotics-can-help-your-healthand here ’ s a quote from that article : “ probiotics are the new vitamins , ” says shekhar challa , md , a gastroenterologist in topeka , ks , and the author of probiotics for dummies . that ’ s a bold statement , because probiotics are actually live microbes — specifically , beneficial bacteria that promote human health if consumed in large enough quantities . for germophobic americans , it ’ s a revolutionary concept . but the 100 trillion microbes that live in your large intestine do dozens of good things for you . they process indigestible fibers and help keep bowel function regular . they produce a number of vitamins , including b6 , b12 , and k2 , and aid in the absorption of minerals such as iron , calcium , and magnesium . equally important , they help fend off bad bacteria such as salmonella and e. coli , which can cause diarrhea and , in extreme cases , severe anemia , kidney failure , and death.wow. thank you ! of all the things i ’ ve considered and read about , this makes the most sense . could you please recommend a specific “ human micro flora type of probiotic ” brand and type that you ’ ve had success with , and trust ? would highly appreciate it.also , some have reported anecdotally that fasting produces positive results in improving the macrobiome in regards to b12 status . any thoughts ? thanks again for any suggestions on a probiotic brand / product.you ’ re welcome , i hope it helps to keep your b12 levels up . i recommend hmf forte powder by genestra , keep it refrigerated and take it with food.fasting is a therapy that i have little experience with.according to joel fuhrman : “ americans eat 51 % of their diet from processed foods and foods low in phytochemicals and antioxidants , ” he says . “ so you see a buildup of waste products in the cells — age , advanced glycation end products — that build up in cellular tissues and lead to atherosclerosis , aging , diabetes , nerve damage , and the deterioration of organs . ” perhaps it ’ s the buildup of the ages that affects the gut microbiome and by fasting our healthy gut flora is better able to support the production of b12 and other nutrients . maybe dr. greger can point us to a study on this ? please let me know if things improve for you on the probiotic supplement.i tried to post a reply earlier but it didn ’ t show up as a posting . i ’ ll try again here.first of all , thanks so much for your reply . do you have a specific brand of “ human micro flora type of probiotic ” you would recommend ? i ’ d highly appreciate it , and of all the things that have been suggested to me , and that i ’ ve read online , your suggestion seems the most logical . thanks.hmf forte by genestra . you can get it in powder form.something you might consider is which nutrients which are particularly high in whatever shellfish you are consuming . oysters , for example , are high in zinc which is generally low in vegan diets . you could try adding a food source of zinc like pumpkin seeds and see if that has the same effect as the shellfish . while i haven ’ t heard of zinc being directly being associated with homocysteine levels it might work indirectly , thanks for this question , i am always researching about b12 because i also can ’ t take it in supplement form , as it causes me extreme anxiety ( even though i normally do not suffer from anxiety at all ) . one time i almost had a full blown panic attack when i took it . it feels as though i just drank like 20 cups of coffee or something . it feels absolutelly horrible . but i can never find that much info about this , besides a few forum posts about other people feeling the same symptoms . just wondering if these are the same kind of issues you have when taking it in supplement form ? i dont have issues when i eat foods / drinks fortified with b12 , but i think this might be because the amounts are much much smaller ( always way less than 100 % rda ) than the supplement form . the supplement amounts of it are crazy high ! ! ! i am technically a pescatarian so i do eat fish and shellfish , but only sometimes … i mostly eat vegetarian and vegan . but just because of the fact that i can ’ t supplement b12 and i certainly do not wanna become deficient , i wouldnt even consider going full on vegan . i ’ ve had my b12 tested last year and my levels were not deficient but not amazing either , i would say kind of borderline . i was even experiencing some symptoms that are associated with b12 deficiency … tingling in the legs , rls , depression , insomnia , etc . my doctor said my blood work was considered normal , so she didnt think that this was related to b12 . but since i have done so much research on this i felt like i was more informed about it than just some random gp who told me it was just stress and that i should try to relax ! so i started eating more clams every week and all my symptoms dissapeared . i now try to eat clams once per week and i have been feeling great . i also eat some fortified cereals and nut milks sometimes , but i don ’ t want to have to be loading up on those every day just to get barely enough b12 , when i can get wayyyy more of it from just a small serving of clams and eating them doesn ’ t cause me any weird symptoms . anyway , i wish that i could just take it in supplement form without any of these weird symptoms , it would definitelly make things much easier and i could consider goin full vegan . anyway , thanks for the article and thanks again for the question and discussion elsie . it ’ s at least comforting to know there are others out there like me when it comes to b12.hi je ! just looking at your question … and was wondering if possibly it ’ s something added to the b12 supplement that ’ s causing your symptoms ? some b12 supplements contain added ingredients and colors … did you see this piece dr. g. did about artificial food colorings and adhd symptoms ? not that adhd is the same as the anxiety symptoms the b12 supplement causes you , but it just occured to me that maybe there was a connection ? it ’ s not a genetic issue , the b12 in supplements is trash , like all supplements . it ’ s not the same as real b12 . where does a gorilla get is b12 ? where does the giraffe get it ’ s b12 ? where does an elephant get it ’ s b12 ? why is it that the natural way all animals get b12 is hidden from the public ? i ’ m not yet sure exactly which is our natrual way to get it , but i ’ m pretty sure it ’ s natrual river or stream water . bacteria can only form in water , and that water can ’ t have high oxygen levels . you simply can ’ t get b12 from a place that has no water , it comes from water and nothing else . mushrooms have b12 on them too , as long as they are not washed . – i am about to do an experiment , sense going and getting river water sounds like a pain , i ’ m going to try a few things : rib moist dirt on my arm before i sunbake , than lick my arm after ( this will kill all bacteria sense bacteria can ’ t survive outside of water , hopefully the b12 microbe is uneffected ) . this is also way to test if licking your arm can rise vitamin d to high levels , vitamin d washes away from water and can take 5 days to absorb into your skin , licking my be the ultimate way to go. ill also try using the sun to distill water at home than put some dirt in , mix and drink. ill try mud bathing as well , that might be enough to get b12 . – in theory putting some dirt in distilled water will work , just use a bucket , place a glass in the middle to catch the water , put water in the bucket around the glass , food wrap / plastic wrap over the top of bucket and a little rock or weight in the middle over the glass.i ’ ve been a total vegan for the past 15 years and for that time have eaten nutritional yeast ( supplemented with b12 ) to compensate for the absence of animal products in my diet . four months ago , on routine physical exam blood tests , i showed a sl. macrocytic anemia . my primary care ordered a b12 assay , and it was significantly low . everything else is normal , and because of my age ( 77-yr old female ) he is assuming that i have a reduced capacity to absorb b12 through the gut ( decreased intrinsic factor etc . ) . i am now on sub-lingual daily b12 , and will go back for another b12 in two months to see if it makes a difference . what surprised me was that i did not have any of the typical symptoms of a b12 deficiency , although it ’ s possible that my levels were not low enough for me to develop clinical symptoms.6rtury : i ’ m glad you caught it in time – ie before you experienced symptoms . i ’ d say that you are doing pretty good . i hope the daily b12 makes a difference . if you are interested , please report back and let us know . i ’ ve been taking the b12 sublingual weekly . and i wonder if it makes enough of a difference . ( not that i ’ m low as far as i know . but i couldn ’ t get my previous doctor to do the test that dr. greger recommends – just the less reliable test , which showed normal . and my current doctor is blood test averse . ( sigh ) . ) good luck to you.have you had your mma serum level tested ? how about your homocysteine serum level ? can you tolerate b12 injections , elsie ? not at all . and for a while i thought it was just me , so i considered keeping it going and just waiting till it worked , but i ’ ve since discovered folks who have horrible reactions to the injections . who knows , maybe there are proteins / amino acids in the shellfish that my body depends on to create all these mechanisms / cycles / processes to occur in my body that are related to b12 / folate / homocsyteine , ec . , and that for some reason plant proteins are not as effectively utilized in me . once again , it is very frustrating , but i am sure as heck not the only one who has claimed to wither / suffer when 100 % vegan . i feel a bit lucky that i ’ ve been able to avoid beef , poultry , eggs , dairy . and i keep the shellfish minimal , not an everyday food.for a while i couldn ’ t decide whether to get injections or just take a sub-lingual . in the end i decided to compromise and get sub-lingual injections.i ’ ll add that a big part of my bringing this issue to light here is not just for my own well being , but for that of those who hope to become 100 percent vegan but who have not been able to due to this issue with b12 supplements . i think if this “ riddle ” can be solved , they ’ ll be that many more who are now willing / able to be vegan . it is obviously not the majority who are intolerant to b12 supplements , but i do find it interesting that most people i know who have had their b12 level tested have never had their homocysteine and mma levels tested , and most doctors i ’ ve met with rarely test homocysteine and mma to check b12 status.do you know that there are increasingly reliable sources of plant based b12 , if we consider japanese and korean research , such as korean nori , and perhaps , hydrilla verticillata , which may be the greatest source of b12 ever discovered ! http : / / www.feelgoodplanet.info / bioavailable _ plant _ sources _ of _ b12.htmlperhaps it is simply isolates that your body is rejecting.warmly , daniel.i ’ ve read over the nori b12 debate / studies . i ’ m not comfortable ingesting massive quantities of iodine ( from the nori ) in order to maintain healthy mma , homocysteine , and b12 levels , yet experience has shown me that there ’ s merit to the effectiveness of raw nori , in regards to the b12 issue.hi , actually , raw nori has relatively low levels of iodine , in relation to other sea vegetables , and particularly in contrast to kelp , and anyhow ; plant based iodine is often lacking in our diet . check for yourself : - ) yeah , i am aware of that . but the amount of nori needed to maintain adequate levels of b12 , mma , and homocysteine , for me , would all of the sudden turn into high iodine intake . when i greatly exceed iodine intake from nori , i notice some benefit , but unless i do this the nori does not seem like a long term solution to the b12 issue . ) point being , i ’ m convinced that i ’ d have to take well over 1000 percent of rda of iodine ( to consume enough of the b12 in nori ) to help me . not gonna do that.yes , but that is a western standard . you would not intake more iodine than the average japanese citizen . unless one consumes vast quantities of seaweed ; you highly unlikely to have any problem with excessive bio-iodine intake . anyhow , the active b12 content of raw korean nori is on par with some of the most excellent sources of animal based b12.furthermore , chlorella is another option , but check its contents . and hydrilla as i mentioned in my first post is the richest source of b12 ever discovered , although it remains unknown as to how much of that b12 is fully active.regards ! i ’ d rather not debate the merits of excessive iodine intake . i ’ ve read over the data , and there are plenty of experts and doctors who have concluded that it is not safe to exceed the iodine level . i am aware of the japanese intake of iodine . for me , and my health and body , it does not seem prudent to follow that path . and this is through direct experience . excessive iodine intake has not been a good thing for me . but to each their own , whatever works for you and your body.firstly , i was not debating anything : - ) . it is a fact that the japanese intake more than 10 time the western recommended level of iodine , without issue , quite the contrary . a few communities by the sea , in japan , do in fact intake excessive quantities of iodine , but they are including massive amounts of seaweeds and seafoods , far exceeding common japanese intake levels , and even then , most members of such communities do not have any issues . if you have certain thyroid disorders ; significant iodine intake can be an issue , even when it is in taken in its bio form , via plant based foods.secondly , i provided you with several other options , instead of animal foods . and seafood likewise contain large quantities of iodine.warmly.yes , i didn ’ t think you were debating . i just thought it might head that way , so i mentioned it . thanks for all your suggestions and info.have you tried sea-buckthorn berries ? i have not . i see online that people are making claims that this has true b12 in it , but i have yet to see any credible research on this , and for now i will assume that if it contained true active b12 the sea buckthorn would be the biggest hit in the vegan community to date , and this berry has been around for a while . i know of no one in the vegan community that is relying on seabuckthorn berries for b12 , and i think the only way i ’ d be comfortable gauging its b12 merit is to run mma , homocysteine , b12 tests after a significant time of relying on just that for b12.but not to say it is not legitimate b12 . just going with my gut for now . if you have credible scientific evidence to share with this community ( dr. greger , most importantly ) , please post it here , as soon as possible . otherwise , i think the berries just might be another “ superfood ” marketing product.yeah you could wait a couple of years for someone to do a randomised controlled trial , or you could just eat some sea-buckthorn berries and see if they do the trick . or maybe even some black trumpet mushrooms . to some extent i think it ’ s distasteful to let other people do your guinea pigging for you . the trouble is that shellfish are one of the biggest causes of food poisoning , so if it was me i ’ d be doing everything i can to find a less riskier source of b12 and not being all “ show me the evidence and then maybe i ’ ll think about it ” .yeah , i hear yah on the shellfish concerns , but with b12 , “ show me the evidence ” is of critical concern and importance . if there is one vitamin you don ’ t want to take a chance being deficient in , this is the one ( so it seems ) .all i know is we need to put our heads together and try to find you a less snotty source of b12 . because i think you ’ re putting yourself in serious danger here . in serious danger of basing your diet on something that looks like it belongs in a ruffled handkerchief if nothing else . my money is on the sea-buckthorn berries . although probably not the more cultivated varieties . why not give it a shot , because there really is no risk from giving it a try . even if it ’ s inactive you ’ re not gonna suffer from nerve damage just from just a three / four week trial.if you have a reputable source of sea buckthorn berries , please post it here . i ’ ll consider trying it out . thanks.also , have you used seabuckthorn as your exclusive source of b12 ? have you tried sea buckthorn berries ? did they raise your b12 ? did they lower your homocysteine reading on a blood test ? i was disappointed that when i asked my doctor for a homocysteine test , he said , “ there is nothing that can be done to lower the levels so there isn ’ t any need to do the test ” . this doctor believes in preventative medicine , vegan diet and healthy lifestyle and drugs only when absolutely necessary.i am not as well informed on this subject as i would like but i have a general question . for people who want to be 100 % vegan but realize the need for b12 supplement , from what source is / are the b12 supplements derived ? i ’ m assuming there are vegan sources of this nutrient.the vitamin b12 component in b12 supplements and fortified foods is not necessarily from animal sources , it is made by bacteria and sourced from bacteria cultures . read your supplement labels-some companies use gelatin . check out this video on the safest sources of b12 : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / safest-source-of-b12 / elsie : thanks for your post . i don ’ t know if i ’ ve had those tests or not . i do know i won ’ t get them from my current doctor.i ’ ll keep what you wrote in mind . i hope you are able to find an alternative . that is indeed very frustrating.thea , if your doctor won ’ t order the test for you and you really want to know ; order the test yourself from an online lab . your insurance may not pay but you will knowbruce : i didn ’ t know that was possible . how do you get the blood to them ? are you supposed to draw it yourself . ( yikes ! ) they provide a prescription and send you to a local lab they work with.oh cool . i might just do that.i am guessing that some such companies are better than others in terms of quality of results . and maybe cost ? ? ? does anyone have specific recommendations ? thanks ! no idea which companies might be better.dr mark hyman , author of the blood sugar solution , recommends going to this website for self testing : http : / / www.saveonlabs.com / which uses quest diagnostics , or you could go to http : / / www.walkinlab.com / which uses labcorp.thanks for the tips ! have you had your mma serum level tested ? how about your homocysteine serum level ? i ’ d suggest you test these as soon as possible . please report back to us any results . thanks ! 6rtury , i stopped relying on nutritional yeast for b-12 some years ago esp from bulk bins . red star makes nutritional yeast with and without b-12 supplementation . twice i have discovered that bins labeled as nutritional yeast w b-12 were falsely labeled . i found this out by asking staff at moms and tpss to show me the bag in the storeroom they were filling the bin with . each time the box was labeled red star yeast without b-12 . it is an easy mistake for any store to make and i wish that red star would only make one form of yeast , one that has b-12 . i believe that b-12 tablets are the most accurate source , do not rely on nutritional yeast.david : this is a great tip . i only eat nut yeast for pleasure , but i would not have guessed that this could be problem in the bulk bins either . i would have previously referred people to nutritional yeast as an option without qualification . so , thanks again.someone more qualified than i thought to fix this week wikipedia article . “ while detection of high levels of homocysteine has been linked to cardiovascular disease , there is no evidence that treatment with b-complex vitamin supplements to lower homocysteine levels improves outcomes . ” http : / / en.m.wikipedia.org / wiki / homocysteinemethyl- or cyano- ? ? i look for the methylcobalamin b12 as i ’ ve heard the cyanocobalamin b12 is significantly less effective . cyano appears typically cheaper , if it isn ’ t doing what my body is needing , then it certainly isn ’ t worth it regardless of cheaper price . i don ’ t think dr. g has addressed these two varieties that are commonly available.robert : i believe that dr. greger addressed your question / concern here : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / which-type-of-b12-is-best / if i may add my “ two cents ” to the discussion , the bioavailability factor of the b12 vitamin taken is one of , if not , the key factor involved , which would mean organic sources , i.e. , chemical-free foods and supplements rather than synthetics and pharmaceuticals . also , for any one of the b vitamins to be utilized efficiently by the human body , the entire spectrum of b vitamins needs to be present / supplemented . at least that ’ s what i learned when i studied nutrition.can you have too much b12 ? on my last blood test , my b12 levels were actually above the “ sufficient ” level , despite being vegangreat question simone . the standard cbc test for b12 is pretty much useless . b12 levels will always appear extremely elevated on that test if you are taking supplements with b12 in them . a more functional analysis would be mma ( methylmalonic acid ) but even that is not always an accurate indication of b12 needs . i encourage my clients to take b12 for at least two months and look to symptoms to determine if their needs are being met . as a water soluble nutrient , the safety margins on b12 are very high.thanks for the reply ! re b12 supplements : 1 . which type ? 2 . how much ? 3 . how often ? thank you.dommy : check out this link : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / what-is-the-best-way-to-get-b12 / i wonder if any research has been done on meat fortification . the animals get supplemented ( google for lifestock fortification ) so my question would be : what would the b12 , vitamin d levels etc. be for meat which wasn ’ t fortified / supplemented.nearly all meat is contaminated with feces which contains an abundance of b12 , meat eaters feces consumption is what gives them their b12 , its quite disgusting.han that ’ s the question that i wanna know the answer to as well . i wish i ’ d seen your post earlier because i just spent half an hour writing about the exact same thing.ah , thanks for the heads up . yes , it ’ s a fascinating question.dr gregeri don ’ t understand why you never mention the fact that most farm animals are given some form of cobalt and / or b12 supplement in order to prevent b12 deficiency . aside from any other interesting questions this raises , it represents a massive indirect b12 supplement for the people who consume those animals , and to my knowledge this has never been adjusted for in any study comparing b12 status of vegans vs non-vegans.not that this means vegans shouldn ’ t supplement with b12 of course . if anything , the fact that so many pasture-raised animals need some form of b12 / cobalt supplement
60	comparing vegans ' arteries to runners ' we know from the work of drs. dean ornish and caldwell b. esselstyn jr. that switching to a plant-based diet can reverse heart disease , opening up arteries in some cases without drugs or surgery . we can ’ t wait until our first heart attack to start eating healthy , though , because our first symptom of heart disease may be our last ( see china study on sudden cardiac death ) . fifty percent of men and 64 % of women who die suddenly from coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms . to predict the risk of dying from a heart attack , we can measure risk factors such as cholesterol levels and blood pressure . but wouldn ’ t it be nice to actually see what ’ s going on inside our arteries before it ’ s too late ? our imaging technologies are so good now that we can , but the required dose of radiation delivered to one ’ s chest is so high that a young woman getting just a single scan may increase her lifetime risk of breast cancer and lung cancer by between around 1 % and 4 % . more on the radiation risks associated with diagnostic procedures in cancer risk from ct scan radiation and do dental x-rays cause brain tumors ? our carotid arteries , though , which connect our heart to our brain , come close enough to the surface in our necks that we can visualize the arterial wall using harmless sound waves ( ultrasound ) . carotid artery wall thickness is what was measured in the study i profiled in eggs vs. cigarettes in atherosclerosis . how do the arteries of those eating plant-based diets compare to those eating the standard american diet ? researchers gathered up some vegans to find out . in the video , arteries of vegans vs. runners , you can see the thickness of the inner wall of the carotid arteries where the atherosclerotic plaque ( considered a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality ) builds up in the standard american diet group . this same inner layer was significantly slimmer in vegans , but so were the vegans themselves . those eating the standard american diet were , on average , overweight with a bmi over 26 while the vegans were a trim 21 — about 36 pounds lighter on average . so maybe the only reason those eating meat , eggs , and dairy had thickened arterial walls was because they were overweight — maybe the diet per se had nothing to do with it . to solve the riddle one would have to find a group of people still eating the standard american diet , but as slim as vegans . to find a group that trim , researchers had to use long-distance endurance athletes , who ate the standard american diet , but ran an average of 48 miles per week for 21 years . both the vegans and the conventional diet group were sedentary — less than an hour of exercise a week . as you can see in the video , the average thickness of endurance runners ’ carotid arteries is between that of sedentary vegans and omnivores . it appears that if we run an average of about a thousand miles every year we can rival some couch potato vegans . but that doesn ’ t mean we can ’ t do both . another comparison between athletes and plant-eaters can be found in is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? it compares cancer-fighting abilities with a similar result . none of this is to disparage exercise , which is critical for a variety of important reasons , immunity ( preserving immune function in athletes with nutritional yeast ) , breast health ( exercise & breast cancer ) , and brain protection ( reversing cognitive decline ) . so diet and exercise , not or exercise . my physical activity comes from walking while i work : standing up for your health . not all studies showed vegans have superior arterial form and function . find out why in my video vitamin b12 necessary for arterial health . i ’ d like to comment on “ … but the required dose of radiation delivered to one ’ s chest is so high that a young woman getting just a single scan may increase her lifetime risk of breast cancer and lung cancer by between around 1 % and 4 % . ” however , mammograms are considered the ‘ gold standard ’ in breast cancer prevention , yet they are sources of ionizing radiation – the very cause of cancers ! when will mds , the cancer industry and healthcare insurance providers realize that there is a more effective and totally non-radiation-producing breast screening test available for women that is fda approved ? it ’ s thermography , which detects heat from cancer cells and , therefore , can provide cancer-detection information much sooner than a mammogram can . also , can yearly mammograms be one of the ‘ unrealized ’ causes of lung cancers in women who don ’ t smoke ? just a thought.they know . of course they know . this is cancer , inc . highly lucrative for everyone involved to keep the industry going.and when you bring along some vitamins and food onto the airplane , it all gets x-rayed in security . then you eat it ! and the food and vitamins absorb radiation 1000s feet in sky , then you eat it . fast from food when flying ? buy supplements at store when back on ground ? indeed , they do know the truth . it has been accurately stated that if a woman continues to get her annual mammograms , doctors will eventually find cancer … because the accumulated result of mammograms is cancer . never forget that cancer is a 200 billion dollar ( plus ) per year industry . if cancers are suddenly cured , do we honestly think that the thousands of oncologists will go to work at home depot and the countless huge cancer hospitals will be converted to seminaries and hotels ? the proliferation and propagation of cancer buys too many mansions , yachts , airplanes , chemotherapy drugs , gmo farms , da vinci machines and mercedes to be defeated in this day and age.just curious , where did you get the info that thermography can be more effective and find cancer earlier ? because what i ’ ve read has said the opposite , that it is in fact less effective . however , i would love to be believe your claim and see some evidence to the contrary.this site would recommend after a mammogram eating some dried ginger and lemon balm lemonade . perhaps after a mammogram the patient could eat some beets , garlic , broccoli , apples , lemonade , cranberries , ginger , tumeric with pepper , cloves , oregano , rosemary , chamomile , white tea with lemon , matcha , dandelion tea , peanuts , pecans , walnuts , nori sheets , mushrooms , black beans , and black raspberries . i think it is very important to note that persons administering the mammograms are very likely to get cancer for the same reason . mammograms are a major cause of breast cancer ? while they are highly recommended for prevention ? that must be what holds women to the health they have.she read it on some radical misinformed “ occupy movement ” type website . therefore , it must be factual … and even more authoritative than the peer-reviewed reproducible independent clinical studies that contradict her conjecture.well , catherine … since you ’ re the one claiming that thermography is “ more effective for women ” at detecting breast cancer , perhaps you should cite a continuum of peer-reviewed reproducible clinical studies validating it . if not , your entire post amounts to hyperbole and unfounded opinion . this is a website about facts and clinical studies , not erroneous opinion.as a home health nurse i visited a male who was 65 years old and had run 29 marathons in his life . he had started feeling short of breath and his doctors though maybe it was his asthma flaring up . his pcp sent him to a cardiologist for a heart work up and he ended up in the hospital for a 5 vessel cardiac bypass . i didn ’ t have the opportunity to ask him what his diet consisted of but i ’ m sure he was not on a whole foods plant based diet with very little added oil.diane : great post . now-a-days , people equate skinny and active with healthy . while those are two ingredients that help lower someone ’ s risk factors , they by no means indicate a healthy individual . it ’ s like saying that vegan = healthy without specifying more details about the vegan part of the diet . your story helps to make the point . thanks.i always thought large amounts of vigorous exercise were better than less and easy exercise . but james o ’ keefe ( cardiologist ) and others have written papers documenting mechanical heart issues and also increased artery plaque buildup for those participating in extreme / long-endurance exercise . these weren ’ t necessarily low-fat athletes , so i can imagine why increased blood flow of fatty blood would increase plaque buildup , but the mechanical failures of the heart later in life bother me a bit . i ’ d be willing to bet that vegan marathoners don ’ t have the save plaque buildup , but the mechanical bit is interesting . i played soccer intensely for a couple hours a day when i was in my teens.o ’ keefe talks about it in this ted talk : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

f = 22 & t = 43482the o ’ keefe video was interesting but the better video was “ the most important lesson from 83,000 brain scans ” by daniel amen . i want to know what the reversing brain damage brain smart program is.dr. greger . i ’ d be interested to know what your cardiac risk factor stats look like . i am 61 y / o with a bmi of 21 . total cholesterol 146 . hdl 70 . trigycerides 40 . my preferred forms of exercise are resistance tubes , especially for developing upper body strength , and something you once mentioned with a chuckle : whole body vibration . i can tell you that it is no joke , assuming you have the proper equipment . on black friday last i purchased a hypervibe machine . believe me when i tell you you won ’ t be laughing if you try doing pushups and squats for ten minutes at 17 g ’ s . there is mounting evidence that brief , high intensity exercise is more beneficial than prolonged “ cardio ” . plus , as the editor of ironman magazine put it , “ you look better when you ’ re naked ” .thanks for saying brief high intensity exercise is better than high endurance exercise . i think this might be because you are more likely to do it . just running three laps a day can cut your heart disease risk in half . the only thing is , there was a way to get people to keep the exercise up . they called it a cure for many illnesses . recommendations for one half hour of high intensity exercise made many people give it up entirely , and for their lives . with a hdl reading of 70 , you are unlikely to die any time and may make it to 100 or later , your thinness will also grant you long life , matthew you nailed it . something is better than nothing.the main questions : 1 ) you must consult your doctor for high intense exercises 2 ) how much time do you have to do exercises ? 3 ) how many days in a week you can train ? 4 ) do your body prepare for high intense exercise ? high risk of injuries is boring for you walk or run , or train at the same rhythm ? high intense exercises disturb your sleep ? there isn ’ t any evidence to support the vibration machines . i had a company try and get me to endorse its use but the research is lacking.it is interesting subject you brought up dr. gregor . i am internist who has been vegan for 12 years. i have intolerance to statins and my baseline total cholestrol was 356. with ldl of 234 . i have been offering cimt test from office for last 7 years . 7 years ago despite vegan diet my ldl was still 140 . my cimt at age 58 indicated that i had arteries of 54 years old . which was a pleasant surprise but i did not know the reason until 3years later at age 61 , when i rechecked my cimt and found my arteries were of someone 45 years old . at the same time i checked cimt on a dentist friend who had run in more than 30 marathons . he had a ldl of 109 and weighed the same as i. we are same age.his artery age was 71.shocked i took diet history and found that since he ran 40-50 miles a week to maintain weight he used large amount of whey protein and ice cream.that convinced me and several others of colleagues benefits of vegan diet.do you think vegans live longer ? if so how much longer ? if the benefit is that stark , how do we not give into temptation and eat animal products like yogurt and chicken for taste ? i had heard the probiotics in yoguart could make you live longer.yes indeed.studies show vegans may gain 3.7 years to 6.5 years depending upon which study you look at.difference tends to decrease by the 9th decade of life.but more important than longer life expectancy is quality of life.vegans and vegetarians suffer from fewer heart attacks and strokes in the 60 ’ s and also have lower risk of disabling conditions such as osteoarthritis . as far as probiotics ae concerned i have not come across any scientific evidence of that .. thank you very much ! by being a vegan i could gain 3.7 to 6.5 years of life . that may be on top of being a vegetarian , because according to the lora dunning university , vegetarians live 8 or more years longer than other californians if you ’ re a man or 4 years longer if you ’ re a woman . did you know that donating blood can add ten years to your life as a man ? it causes an enormous drop in blood pressure all month and removes a lot of iron and “ spent ” or malfunctioning proteins . i wish i had the will power to eat vegan all year and donate blood every month . this site shows that eating vegan is the healthiest path . there are other avenues to longevity . it is thought that people live longer with regards to how close they are to the center of a country or the capitol . for instance , white men live more than ten years longer than average in d.c. and there are more black 100 year olds there than anywhere else . having sex and being married can add years to your life , and being a mother drops a woman ’ s risk of all cancer of her reproductive tract . swimming is so good for you that it should be part of any life , as is reading and meditating . i am going to find the ideal path to long life with this website in mind.matthew smith : here is another study that should interest you ( from pcrm breaking news ) : “ vegetarian diets can extend life expectancy , according to early findings from the adventist health study-2 . vegetarian men live to an average of 83.3 years , compared with nonvegetarian men who live to an average of 73.8 years . and vegetarian women live to an average of 85.7 years , which is 6.1 years longer than nonvegetarian women . this study is ongoing and includes more than 96,000 participants . the results further indicate vegan diets to be healthful and associated with a lower body weight ( on average 30 lbs. lower than that of meat eaters ) , and lower risk of diabetes , compared with diets that include animal products.fraser g , haddad e. hot topic : vegetarianism , mortality and metabolic risk : the new adventist health study . report presented at : academy of nutrition and dietetic ( food and nutrition conference ) annual meeting ; october 7 , 2012 : philadelphia , pa . ” also , note that dr. greger is working on a book right now on this very topic . so , we should be getting some awesome data / ideas on longevity when he is done.thank you very much for your reply ! i have found great help from your site here . i think it is not just diet that can add to life but also lifestyle choices : meditating can add ten years to your life . swimming can add ten years to your life . being married , can ten years to your life . listening to classical music can add many years to your life . going to church or temple or prayer group can add ten years to your lifewhat would happen if you did all of them and were a vegan ? i really like that you shared this study . i am surprised that the vegetarians lived that much longer . it must be more of a benefit than just being a devoted adventist . perhaps they both have a benefit . is dr. greger interested in demography ? they study lifespan and population ecology in humans . where would people go to live the longest ? current thinking says washington d.c. for white men , perhaps because it is the center of our society . many asians in hawaii make that the longest lived state in america . i would ask if indians living near the capitol of india live longest , since they are at the capitol of a vegetarian society . where are people the tallest ? the healthiest ? the smartest ? the hardest working ? the longest lived ? these are the questions of a demographer . i think it is based on how close you live to a federal banking institute . vegetarianism seems to have the same kind of benefit as being a demographer or cultural treasure.being married , can ten years to your life , if you end up with a good one ^ ^ matthew do you eat animal products everyday ? once i actually gave them up i wasn ’ t temped . it ’ s funny but if i inadvertently eat something with animal , like mashed potatoes the butter tastes rancid to me . nasty.yes , i eat animal products everyday . i every now and then i am tempted by them when really i am demonstrating that it is healthier to not eat them . i would love to be a vegetarian again . i have switched to soy milk in cereal and brown rice instead of white . it is divine . i have lost weight eating less meat and taking the fenugreek supplement . i have found a better quality of life for myself by naming the healthiest plant foods when i repent . amla , nori , mushrooms , black raspberry , and all in the center of my intestines , if i repent them there , help me to feel as healthy as when i was a younger man , a vegetarian . dr. greger said the plant based diet can give the benefit of the reduced calorie diet . i am interested in getting the benefit of being a vegan , with no cholesterol and low saturated fat . thank you for showing me why less meat you eat the less you like it . i eat whole grain cheerioes with flax seed and soy protein powder as milk , grapefruit , a blueberry greek yougart with extra blueberries , a pot of matcha tea , and then i try to eat beans , nuts , and whole grain . i make a snack of nori , a half mushroom , almonds , walnuts , dark chocolate , kiwi , dried blueberries , golden raisins , and dried pomegrante or ginger for long life . i am interested in finding what i would like for lunch and dinner that doesn ’ t have meat or animal in it . designing meals with orac and cancer reduction in mind saves me time and money . when you eat meat , i think , the igf-1 spike causes you to get hungrier and hungrier . thank your expertise.is it healthier to do moderate exercise of slightly elevated heart rate rather than interval bouts of intense heart zone targeted exercise ? lately ive seen claims that moderate bouts ( not extreme ) of high intensive exercise causes a negative stress response in the body ( more ageing ) . i wonder if they body assumes yr running from a predator.in contrast , ive been told to target high heart rate because my legs feel fatigued when i walk up 3 flights of stairs . i stand most of the day and walk instead of drive . my diet is low fat whole fat vegan with raw nuts and flax seed oil.now someone needs to compare the arteries of a vegan athlete , see what diet and exercise together can do.now someone needs to compare the arteries of a vegan athlete , see what diet and exercise together can do.dr. greger , i have a question about nutritional yeast : i recently noticed that one of the brands sold at my local store had a proposition 65 label on it . alarmed , i called the company to find out why . they explained that nutritional yeast has low levels of lead and that they are required by law to label it for prop 65 in california . they claimed that the lead levels are too low to harm anyone , and also that other brands of nutritional yeast contain lead but that they aren ’ t being labeled . i really can ’ t imagine eating something with enough lead in it that it has to be labeled . what is the deal ?

61	add beans , berries , and greens to more meals after we eat , our bodies create free radicals in the process of breaking down our food . that ’ s why we need to eat antioxidant-rich foods with every meal to counteract this oxidation caused by metabolism . we can ’ t just have berries on our oatmeal in the morning to meet our minimum recommended daily allowance of antioxidants and call it a day . each and every meal should contain high antioxidant foods , which means that each and every meal should contain whole plant foods . antioxidant rich foods originate from the plant kingdom , due to the thousands of different natural antioxidant compounds naturally created by the plants we eat . consuming fruits — which are high in phenolic phytonutrients — increases the antioxidant capacity of the blood . when fruits are consumed along with high fat and refined carbohydrate “ pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory ” meals , they may help counterbalance their negative effects . given the content and availability of fat and sugars in the western diet , regular consumption of phenolic-rich foods , particularly in conjunction with meals , appears to be a prudent strategy to maintain oxidative balance and health . and of all fruits , berries may be the best source of phytonutrients . in the video , how to reach the antioxidant “ rda ” , you can see an example of the spike in oxidation caused by a mediterranean meal of pasta , tomato sauce , olive oil , and fried fish . obviously , given the spike of oxidation , there were not enough tomatoes . add a glass of red wine , which contains berry phytonutrients from grapes , and we can bring down , but not blunt completely , the level of oxidation . so the meal needs even more plants . in a study i profile in the video , researchers gave subjects standard breakfast items , resulting in lots of oxidized cholesterol in their bloodstream one to six hours after the meal . but all it took was a cup of strawberries with that same breakfast to at least keep the meal from contributing to further oxidation . in my food antioxidants and cancer video , you can see a comparison of breakfast with berries versus breakfast without . if we don ’ t consume high-antioxidant plants with breakfast , by lunch we ’ ll already be in oxidative debt . let ’ s say we ate a standard american breakfast at 6 a.m. if we didn ’ t eat that cup of strawberries with breakfast , by the time lunch rolls around we ’ d already be starting out in the hyper-oxidized state , and lunch could just make things worse . since western eating patterns include eating multiple meals a day , including snacks , one can only speculate on the level of biological unrest . if we have some berries for breakfast , at least we ’ d be starting out at baseline for lunch . this acute protection is likely due to the antioxidant effects of the strawberry phytonutrients . what if , by lunch , we could be even better than baseline ? how about our meals actually improving our antioxidant status ? if , for example , we eat a big bunch of red grapes with our meal , the antioxidant level of our bloodstream goes up and our bodies are in positive antioxidant balance for a few hours . we get the same result after eating enough blueberries . and imagine if in these ensuing hours before our next meal we were sipping green tea , hibiscus tea or even whole cranberries ? ( see pink juice with green foam ) . we ’ d have a nice antioxidant surplus all day long . one group of researchers conclude : “ these data provide an interesting perspective for advising individuals on food choice when consuming a moderate- to high-fat meal is unavoidable . ” ( unavoidable ? so what , if we ’ re locked in a fast food joint or something ? ) they suggest chasing whatever we ’ re forced to eat with some berries . reminds me of those studies i ’ ve talked about suggesting that smokers should eat lots of kale and broccoli to reduce the oxidative damage to their dna . of course , they could also just not smoke . in a single day , the systemic stress of all the fat in our blood and “ redox imbalance ” ( being in a mild pro-oxidant state after meals ) may seem trivial . over time , however , these daily insults can lead to problems such as heart disease , contributing to the hundreds of thousands of deaths a year ( see the power of no ) . i strive to eat berries every day and so should everyone . if we are going to drink wine , red is preferable ( see breast cancer risk : red wine vs. white wine ) see how quickly stress can eat our antioxidants in : antioxidant level dynamics . i used a similar meal-components technique to illustrate the potent antioxidant power of spices . see antioxidants in a pinch . all fruits and veggies aren ’ t the same . i make this point in different ways in videos like which fruit fights cancer better ? and anti-inflammatory antioxidants . i have a series of videos on which foods have the most antioxidants . see antioxidant content of 3,139 foods and antioxidant power of plant foods versus animal foods . note these are measured based on test tube tests . there are more sophisticated ways to measure antioxidant activity . see anti up on the veggies . what ’ s the cheapest common source of whole food antioxidants ? see superfood bargains for a dollar per dollar comparison . what ’ s the cheapest uncommon source ? see dragon ’ s blood . are there diminishing returns to getting too many antioxidants ? see maxing out on antioxidants . so if we have that bowl of berries in the morning to meet our minimum daily antioxidant needs can we just call it a day ? . hint : the title of my follow-up video is : antioxidant rich foods with every meal . can one have too much antioxidant ? is it possible to overdose on antioxidants ? there is another video on this website that shows that antioxidants in pill form work counter productive.when i bring up how important antioxidants are for good health , arguments are raised regarding the role of oxidants in oxidative-based apoptosis . my question is , will oxidative-based apoptosis still be able to be carried out by a cell even when it is flooded with antioxidants ? are the hazards of smokers supplementing with vitamin a & e which has been correlated with higher rates of cancer , due to the vitamins ( which are antioxidants ) inhibiting the cellular process of apoptosis ? is it just supplementing with antioxidants that can be disruptive to apoptosis or can one consume too many antioxidants from whole foods ? thanks for your videos and articles . they are inspiring and help me stay resolved.berries have one of the highest rates of oesticide spray . i buy organic , incl , frozen , but it ’ s expensive and sometimes the certification is suspect . i buy conventional ( not organic ) skinned fruits like mango & avocado . with berries eg strawberries am i better to eat less rather than eat with pesticides ? me : good for you for trying to eat a lot of berries . and a very good question you have . dr. greger has a great blog post where he puts pesticide consumption into perspective . : “ a new study calculated that if half the u.s. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables , 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented . at the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases . so by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk , but that ’ s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption . even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks . ” from : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 06 / 25 / apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes / i translate this bit of info into : eat organic when you can , but don ’ t stress about it when you can ’ t.happily , there is a way to take this advice a step further to minimize your risks without completely depleting the pocketbook . every year , the environmental working group actually measures pesticide levels in fruits and veggies – after those fruits and veggies have been prepared in the way people would normally eat them . ( for example , peeling a banana or washing first . ) if you scroll down on the following page , you will see a list for the “ dirty dozen ” and the “ clean fifteen ” .http : / / www.ewg.org / foodnews / summary.phpi bring your attention to these lists because i think they are very helpful for people who can ’ t afford to eat organic for everything . you could use these lists to help you decide when it is worth putting down money for organic and when it might be safer to buy non-organic.i hope this helps ! dr. greger is a crusader for the true nature of medicine , prevention . this article truly underscores how we have the power to improve our health and improve our lives . his detailed literature reviews show that beans , greens , and berries , are some of the most powerful ways to improve our health . spinach , broccoli , onions , garlic , brussels sprouts , kale , collards , carrots , and beets are some of the most powerful cancer prevention foods there are and , understanding that 40 percent of americans get cancer , are disproportionately valuable to health . berries are filled with nutrition and can help the mind age gracefully or even improve as it ages , making a cup a day necessary for living longer . even a cup of raisins ( he recommends golden raisins ) count , beans are the most powerful tool at managing many chronic diseases we can get , heart disease , diabetes , cancer , and other age related diseases considered to be unavoidable by some . i think dr. greger is ahead of his time in trying to stop end of life diseases when so many doctors are busy treating colds , coughs , and bruises . with a rosehip tea and a cup of spinach with its vitamin k , he might put medicine out of business . i think beans , greens , and berries are necessary for health . if he made this into a fibonacci , he could add two or five more things , like nuts ( half your heart disease risk and some cancers ) , dark chocolate , green tea , fresh fruit , and whole grain are also really valuable . his food recommendations could eliminate heart disease , add ten or more years to life , guarantee living to 85 , reduce risk of colon cancer , improve mood , limit most cancers , restrict risk of stroke or cancer , reduce or manage heart disease and diabetes , reduce your risk of heart disease and sudden heart disease , make you seem five-14 years younger , and limit your ability to get metabolic syndrome and lose weight . these foods include probiotics , grape fruit , orange juice , cherries , ten cups of green tea a day , lemons , green pepper , beans , black raspberries , sunflower seeds. strawberries , bilberries , yellow squash , pistachios , tomatoes , soy , broccoli , watermelon , beets , garlic , flax seeds , seaweed , blueberries , whole grain , grapes or grape juice , nuts , cruciferous vegetable , dark chocolate. lentils , herb tea , sweet potatoes , clove , turmeric , ginger , cranberry juice , pumpkins , apples , hibiscus tea , brazil nuts , macadamia nuts , amla , seaweed , carrots , and tabasco sauce . dr. greger ’ s recommendation to add oregano , chai tea , hibiscus tea with alma , goji berries , cloves , dried pomegrante seeds , and flax seed powder to every diet would mean nobody would ever be short of antioxidants , and he notesthat we do indeed have a daily required amount of them at more than 10,000 a day . “ ten cups of green tea a day ” wow , where is the room for water ? after drinking tea and water there wouldn ’ t be room for food . or time for it either . lolyes thank you . they say health benefits of green tea start at 2 cups a day and continue in the video called the “ asian paradox . ” seven to ten are recommended here . my opinion is that drinking more water is good for you , weight lifters know to drink at least 8 cups of water a day . do you mean to drink that and tea ? i think you can drink tea ( or even matcha ! ) instead of the water.many of these foods are very good . but it ’ s also important to make sure that they are alkaline ( natural ) , with a ph rating of 7.1 or above . alkaline food nourishes the body and protects the mucus membrane in the body , that protective lining that helps prevent disease . some beans are highly starchy , with a ph rating well below 7.1 and research and reports have shown that soybeans and soy lecithin , the byproduct , harm reproductive organs and the immune system . a good book to read about alkaline food is sojourn to honduras sojourn to healing : why an herbalist ’ s view matters more today than ever before.https : / / www.createspace.com / 5074819i am new to this website but i am enjoying reading the information.dr. greger has shown that an unhealthy diet , smoking , obesity , and physical inactivity are the main sources of much of the disease in the country , including america ’ s three leading causes of death : heart disease , cancer , and stoke . “ death in america is largely a foodborne illness , ” dr. greger summarizes in this video : uprooting the leading causes of death , http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death / in that video he said that nut consumption was the highest factor tied to long life , together with fiber ( plants ) consumption , and jogging . eating a cup of oatmeal a day , two handfuls of nuts a week , and jogging four hours a week have the same individual benefit in increasing a woman ’ s life . each 20 grams of beans extra a person eats a day reduces their risk of death by eight percent . is there anything healthier than beans ? maybe roots like ginger , garlic , and beets which are perhaps the most cancer preventative plants in the categories of spices , vegetables , and root crop , are truly worth eating weekly or more often , as my humble offered opinion . i can see that you feel soybeans are unhealthy . they lower the ph of the body , and soy letchithin is an emulsifier in many foods and many fast foods . soy has been said to have heart health benefits and is an unusual complete plant protein . perhaps the fact that soy is meat like , its methione , makes it unhealthy . without soy , beans and rice are just as complete . i would love to eat ph akalizing foods like tea , broccoli , and apples . dr. greger said its not just the number of fruits and vegetables you eat but also the quality of fruits you eat : instead of a banana , try blueberries , instead of ground pepper , try oregano , instead of coffee , try chai tea , instead of lettuce , try purple cabbage , instead of canned peaches , try fresh apples. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 12 / 04 / how-to-get-enough-antioxidants-each-day / i am interested in your reference . i love stories of native healers and ethnobotanical plant prospecting . i am really interested in natural products medicine , in getting medicines from plants . now most drugs are rationally developed at great expenses to patents , with many plants being unused or forgotten as medicines , and many hundreds of faked compounds failing after countless iterations , despite the fact that half of drugs were once discovered from life , and many are still being cultivated for medicine . i am really interested in this site because it shows how whole plants can be used as medicine throughout life . could you find medicine in garlic ? in tomato ? could you use a plant nutrient as a medicine instead of a drug ? could you find the health compound in beans and make it into a drug ? possibly ! maybe it ’ s a similar idea . i think medicine could get close . our native passionfruit was a source of an anti anxiety drug . how many others are in passionflower genus of the tropics ? how many fruit have compounds in their red skin to help animals remember where they were found to keep them evolving to be red to be edible to be spread ? how many drugs are in the sap of the poinsettia plant ? health is evolving with us . herbalists help adapt to the new diseases of the era , an tropical botanists were unable to find cures to metabolic syndrome . several are presented here : fenugreek , hibsicus tea , beans , amla , and nuts.thank you for the response . and thank you for your interest in the reference sojourn to honduras sojourn to healing . i learned about the importance of alkaline ( natural ) food from the book ’ s main subject pathologist and herbal medicine specialist dr. sebi . in my research i was able to confirm what dr. sebi says about acid and alkaline food . i found that popular foods such as garlic , navy beans , and peanuts have ph levels well below alkaline levels of 7.1 . garlic , a toxic substance , has a ph value of 2.9 . it is not an alkaline food . it is considered a good cancer prevention food and good for preventing heart disease , yet it is not alkaline . healthy human blood is alkaline with a ph value of 7.365 , so garlic , according to dr. sebi and the research , should be removed from your daily diet . i agree with you on most things about food , except foods that are not alkaline . peanuts are highly starchy , navy beans and kidney beans as well . many beans are hybrids , cultivated in laboratories so their molecular structure has changed to an unnatural state and toxic state . my research found the following : “ raw kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of phytohemagglutinin , and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not pre-soaked and subsequently heated to the boiling point for at least 10 minutes . the u.s food and drug administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin . [ 2 ] however , cooking at the lower temperature of 80 ° c ( 176 ° f ) , such as in a slow cooker , can increase this danger and raise the toxin level up to fivefold . [ 3 ] ” it is important to share with people foods that are alkaline ( natural ) , foods with ph values of 7.1 and above . these are the foods that protect and nourish the body . remember , healthy human blood is alkaline , with a ph rating of 7.365 . so the foods we eat must have ph ratings the same as or close to 7.365 . for more information about alkaline food and the ph scale read sojourn to honduras sojourn to healing : why an herbalist ’ s view matters more today than ever before. http : / / www.sojourntohonduras.comdr. greger has some videos on the alkaline diet , and he recommends it . alkaline diets , animal protein , & calcium loss http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss / testing your diet with pee & purple cabbage “ an alkaline diet benefits health ” … removes uric acid and supports muscle , also maybe bones.chickpeas , aka garbanzo beans , are far healthier than many beans . and soybeans ? highly toxic . please read what dr. joseph mercola has written about soy and soybeans. http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / dr-mercola / soy-health _ b _ 1822466.html “ who hasn ’ t heard of the marvels of soy ? the marketing bandwagon has touted soy as the perfect health food for decades . but could something that sounds so healthful actually be dangerous ? if you take the time to look into the actual science , then the answer is yes . thousands of studies link soy to malnutrition , digestive distress , immune system breakdown , thyroid dysfunction , cognitive decline , reproductive disorders and infertility — even cancer and heart disease.one of the primary reasons it would be wise for you to avoid soy is that more than 90 percent of soybeans grown in the united states are genetically modified . since the introduction of genetically engineered foods in 1996 , we ’ ve had an upsurge in low birth weight babies , infertility , and other problems in the u.s. , and animal studies have shown devastating effects from genetically engineered soy including allergies , sterility , birth defects , and offspring death rates up to five times higher than normal.soybean crops are also heavily sprayed with chemical herbicides , such glyphosate , which a french team of researchers have found to be carcinogenic.soybeans — even organically grown soybeans — naturally contain “ antinutrients ” such as saponins , soyatoxin , phytates , trypsin inhibitors , goitrogens and phytoestrogens . traditional fermentation destroys these antinutrients , which allows your body to enjoy soy ’ s nutritional benefits . however , most westerners do not consume fermented soy , but rather unfermented soy , mostly in the form of soymilk , tofu , tvp , and soy infant formula.unfermented soy has the following 10 adverse affects on your body : please go to the article to learn what those 10 adverse effects are . you ’ ll be glad you did if you care about your health.thank you , chick peas are very healthy . beans are really recommended here . this site strongly recommends the vegan diet , and soy is a mainstay for those who can ’ t eat meat . i think there really is a difference of opinion if soy is healthy . the fda has approved soy for heart health : “ 25 grams of soy protein a day , as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol , may reduce the risk of heart disease . a serving of ( name of food ) provides _ _ _ _ grams of soy protein . ” i do not question their science , but regularly challenge what kinds of recommendations the federal government makes with regards to diet and exercise . i don ’ t think we have data on which bean is better than another . peanuts are a bean , and eating peanut butter everyday was one of the most surprising findings linked to long life. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-peanut-butter-good-for-you / soy , a mainstay in diet ?

thank you ! ! dr. greger has recommended one chai tea , oregano , cloves , hibiscus tea , dried apples , golden raisins , pecans , walnuts , cocoa , matcha , blueberries , amla , and flax seed . he has recipes ! his pink foam hibiscus tea , super pumpkin pie ( make it with two chai tea bags opened ! ) , and his breakfast smoothie have huge servings of antioxidants . sprinkle oregano on most foods , always have a few leaves of red lettuce , or purple cabbage , drink a chai tea a day and sip hibiscus most days , cloves can go on anything , and for a snack walnuts , golden raisins , and dried apples can ’ t be beat . cloves , rosemary , tumeric with pepper , fresh garlic , and ginger ( or even dried ginger snacks ) are very powerful anti-cancer spices , and oregano is a real powerhouse . dog roses or rose hips and amla are chart toppers . he has listed foods specifically for anti-cancer benefit as well , these are lemons , cranberries , apples , garlic , beets , tomatoes , carrots , broccoli , spinach , collards , pecans , peanuts , walnuts , cloves , ginger , tumeric with pepper , rosemary , hibiscus tea , dandelions tea , chamomile tea , matcha , white tea with lemon , are the best of the bunch for cancer prevention . some foods are very antioxidant dense , like oregano and amla , others not so much . i don ’ t think they list orac units anytime soon , so knowing this , i think we ’ re saying to sip tea , eat nuts , and beans just to be safe.do frozen berries preserve their antioxidants ?

63	how to get enough antioxidants each day we need to get a daily minimum of 8-11,000 antioxidant units a day in our food just to stay out of oxidative debt ( see my video on the reason we need more antioxidants ) . to reach that minimum , all we have to do is eat lots of fruits and vegetables , right ? not exactly . let ’ s say i ate a whole banana during breakfast ( in addition to whatever else ) . for lunch i eat a typical american salad — iceberg lettuce , half cup of cucumber slices , and canned peaches for dessert . supper included a side serving of peas and carrots and half a cup of snap peas along with yet another salad . and , finally , let ’ s say i had a cup of watermelon for dessert . i just ate nine servings of fruits and vegetables and am feeling all good about myself . however , i only made it up to 2700 units , less than a quarter of the way to my minimum daily recommended intake . what am i supposed to do , eat 36 servings a day ? ( for a cool visual of this , check out my video , how to reach the antioxidant “ rda ” ) . what if instead of that banana , i had a single serving of blueberries ? and instead of iceberg lettuce for that afternoon salad , i ate four leaves of red leaf lettuce , maybe some kidney beans on top , and a teaspoon of dried oregano as a bonus ? for a snack , i had an apple and some dates . it ’ s not even suppertime , only had five servings , yet i ’ ve left the minimum recommended daily intake of antioxidants in the dust ( topping 28,000 units ! ) . that ’ s why it ’ s not just quantity of fruits and veggies that matters , but also the quality . all fruits and veggies aren ’ t the same . i make this point in different ways in videos like which fruit fights cancer better ? and anti-inflammatory antioxidants . if possible , we should try to choose the healthiest options out there . now that it ’ s midday and i ’ ve reached my daily minimum of antioxidants with those five super servings , can i just eat whatever i want for dinner ? that ’ s probably not a good idea . the estimated minimum antioxidant need of 8,000-11,000 units does not take into account the added amounts needed if other oxidant stressors — ” such as illness , cigarette smoke , meat consumption , air pollution , sleep deprivation ” — are present . if we had to deal with these stressors we ’ d need to consume more fruits and veggies just to stay out of the red . in my video antioxidant level dynamics , i profiled a study that used an argon laser to measure human antioxidant levels in real time . the study ’ s most important finding was that antioxidant levels can plummet within two hours of a stressful event , but it may take up to three days to get our levels back to normal . the take-home message is that , especially when we ’ re sick , stressed , or tired , we should try to go above and beyond the antioxidant food minimum . ideally , we need to be constantly soaking our bloodstream with antioxidants , meaning that we should consume high-powered fruits and vegetables — like berries , beans , and green tea or hibiscus — all day long . unsure of which foods have the most antioxidants ? i have a series of videos on this very topic . see antioxidant content of 3,139 foods and antioxidant power of plant foods versus animal foods . ( note these are measured based on test tube tests . there are more sophisticated ways to measure antioxidant activity . see anti up on the veggies ) . spices in particular present a powerful source of antioxidants . see antioxidants in a pinch . what ’ s the cheapest common source of whole food antioxidants ? see superfood bargains for a dollar per dollar comparison . what ’ s the cheapest uncommon source ? see dragon ’ s blood . are there diminishing returns to getting too many antioxidants ? see maxing out on antioxidants . so if we have that bowl of berries in the morning to meet our minimum daily antioxidant needs can we just call it a day ? see : antioxidant rich foods with every meal . another reader of nutritionfacts posted a sobering link to a recent blog post . this link contains a statement published by the usda in which the usda casts doubt on the efficacy or importance of antioxidants . the link can be found here : http : / / www.ars.usda.gov / services / docs.htm ? docid = 15866if i remember correctly , dr. greger has said that the usda took down its antioxidant database merely because the data was being used unscrupulously by supplement manufacturers to bolster the questionable health claims they generated to market their supplements . however , this usda statement seems to say something very different . here are some direct quotations : “ recently the usda ’ s nutrient data laboratory ( ndl ) removed the [ antioxidant ] database from the ndl website due to mounting evidence that the values indicating antioxidant capacity have no relevance to the effects of specific bioactive compounds , including polyphenols on human health . ” “ there is no evidence that the beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich foods can be attributed to the antioxidant properties of these foods . ” ( note that the second statement in particular doesn ’ t seem to differentiate between the various ways that a food ’ s antioxidant capacity can be tested . ) this raises a couple of important questions : if we ’ re not using the usda ’ s measure of antioxidant capacity , then what are we using ? where , for instance , do the numbers used in today ’ s blog post , the antioxidant units of various foods , come from ? how do we know that the antioxidants in healthy foods are what make those foods healthy in the first place ? i remember asking myself just this question after watching a video dr. greger posted about a study , conducted in italy i think , in which participants were divided into a high-antioxidant group and a low-antioxidant group . in the study , the high-antioxidant group fared better than the low , and this was presented as strong evidence for the health benefits of high-antioxidant foods . but how do we know it was the antioxidants that did anything ? how can we be sure that some other component of the high-antioxidant foods wasn ’ t responsible for the participants ’ increase in health ? does over reliance and daily consumption of food antioxidants suppress the human body ’ s own “ strength ” and abilities ? does the easy access to all this “ healthy food ” make us actually weaker in the long run , thus making us dependent on fueling our defenses ? people have gone long stretch just eating fish , insects , … .or fasting … .. or whatever to survive . maybe in the abscence of antioxidants they actually become / became stronger ? have humans ever had this much access to such high antioxidant food , and every single day of the year ? great read ! i wanted to provide some research that i use to inform health care professionals about antioxidants and how they can be increased in your body and be scientifically measured . i have a biophotonic scanner that can measure the density of the carotenoid molecules in your skin . when our clients make changes by diet and supplementation , and we measure the increased levels , the clients typically have less colds , infections and inflammations . we have had great success in relieving pain and discomfort with clients with lyme disease and also other patients with ms , fibromyalgia , arthritis , even periodontal disease . but i just wanted to provide you with a list of research from scientists and universities that might be of interest to you ! http : / / www.eternal-age.com / # ! scanner-studies / cuns ( the research references will be on the last , few pages of the pdf ) make it a great day ! the concept of ‘ antioxidants ’ as we have known it has been shown in recent years to be wrong and was based on flawed arguments which go right back to the 1950s . the current science surrounding the way human cells defend themselves is being completely rewritten . what has emerged is that human cells produce their antioxidant and other protective compounds which are literally capable of dealing with millions of reactive oxygen ans nitrogen species ( free radicals ) per second . compare this with one vitamin c molecule which can quench just one free radical – period ! the clinical trials which have been done in hundreds of thousands of humans to investigate a protective effect have failed – spectacularly ! six decades ago we assumed that vitamin c was the reason for the better health in populations who consumed high levels of fruits and vegetables – wrong assumption . so then we turned to phytochemicals such as those found in berries , olives , curcumin , grapes , pomegranates and so on as the reason for the benefit . this is where the orac concept emerged . the usda rightly removed their orac database in 2010 because it was misleading . as it turned out , the orac values were determined by lab bench studies . however , when humans consumed these same compounds , so little of the bioactive compound is absorbed that virtually no antioxidant effect registers in the cells . this is because these polyphenol compounds are such large bulky molecules that they dont get absorbed in sufficient quantity to have an antioxidant effect.the way cells protect themselves is by registering stress signals and these signals activate the genes to enable the cell to produce around 2000 protective compounds – the list includes antioxidant enzymes , detoxification enzymes , glutathione , vitamin d receptor and many more . to activate these ‘ switches ’ in the cell the most effective food compound is the sulforaphane derived from a 100 % whole broccoli sprout compound.the benefits of the berries and other polyphenols occur largely in the digestive tract , and not in the cells as is commonly thought . food manufacturers have exploited this flawed theory in marketing so-called ‘ super ’ foods , amazonian berries and such like.i ’ ve made similar comments ( a , b , c , d , e , f ) . one element of this discussion worth examining more closely is the assumption that ordinary respiration generates the bulk of ros , but this wonderful paper indicates that ’ s an artifact of experiments with non-physiological substrates like succinate . glucose appears to burn relatively “ cleanly ” , and the major sources of ros appear to be peroxisomes oxidizing long-chain fatty acids and superoxide generating enzymes like xanthine oxidase , or the nadph oxidases involved in the oxidative bursts of inflammation . reducing inflammation is a more attractive option than reducing respiration , and fortunately , many so-called “ antioxidants ” appear to do just that , though not via their ros quenching potential.darryl , thanks so much for the link to this paper – this is ‘ right up my alley ’ . you and i are singing from the same song sheet ! however , our voices are drowned out by big health food that continues to perpetrate the same sales hype for so-called antioxidant supplements , masquerading as science.so i ’ m confused , are you and darryl disagreeing with dr. gregor ’ s theory about staying out of oxidative dept as shown in the video ? i can ’ t speak for annette , but i find the evidence indicates many plant compounds like polyphenols , which function as direct antioxidants in the test tube , do not meaningfully contribute in this way when ingested . instead they ’ re doing more complicated things to alter gut microbiota , inhibit inflammatory response , and their oxidized forms may induce our own , more potent and better regulated , antioxidant responses.thanks to our forebears – who believed that truth would emerge with freedom of expression . glucose burns fairly cleanly ? so you ’ re saying that oxidized fats are a more likely source of ros ? where do those superoxide generating enzymes come from ? from the body dealing with oxidized fats ? i realize fats get oxidized when exposed to heat , air , light . so the body also oxidizes fats when it burns fats for energy ? could you explain that process ? dr. greger , as a vegan who periodically fasts ( every couple of weeks i fast for 2-3 days ) , is there some harm being done because antioxidants / phytochemicals are not consumed during these fasts ? looking at some of the antioxidant “ superfoods ” i note that many are very high in c … which leads me to ask if heavy doses of c rich foods meet the bill . or do the various antioxidants tend to “ specialize ” , to protect in more specific ways ? if the latter the usda list is virtually useless.is the answer simply to eat lots of various fruits and veggies , to seasoned up with a variety of spices … and hope you are getting a balance of antioxidants ? surely we can do better than that ! how about that video about the gooseberry powder to enhance antioxidant levels ? why is it not mentioned here ? dr.greger , how do you reconcile with this.http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / nutritionsource / antioxidants / harvard is basically saying don ’ t depend on antioxidant supplements , but get antioxidants from whole foods , like fruits and veggies — pretty much what dr. greger is saying.hello dr. greger . i love your videos ! question : you said the amla powder ( indian gooseberry ) is the # 1 food most rich in antioxidant . how can we be confident that we are consuming enough antioxidants if it ’ s been processed into powder ? doesn ’ t powder oxidize quickly ? how about a nutrition facts app that lets us figure antioxidant intake and net anti-inflammatory intake ? either a separate app based on this website alone or an add-on to lose it or one of the other health apps ? i ’ ve done really well tracking fiber intake with lose it and would love to have an easy way to track other important nutrients.dr. greger ’ s site shows how important antioxidants are at battling the causes of disease : inflammation , oxidation , wear and tear , dilation , clogging , diffusion ( congestive heart failure , more energy for less than peak ) , inconsistency , erratic changes , uneven pathways , stress ( natural responses ) , damage ( igf-1 ) missing chunks , nerve movement ( brain pattern asymmetry ) , pain ( leaks or exacerbated pores ) . he suggests that drinking chai tea , a single cup , has three days worth of antioxidants . other great sources of antioxidants include oregano , cloves , dried apples , hibiscus tea , matcha or green tea , golden raisins , dried pomegrantes , walnuts , pecans , amla powder or tea , blueberries , rosehips or dog rose ( in many hibiscus teas ) , dried flax seeds , beets , and purple cabbage . these foods are winners in their class and have numerous health benefits that have astounding cumulative benefits . antioxidant rich foods can stop , delay , reverse , repair , and restore health damage. antioxidants , apples , bananas , beans , beef , berries , beverages , blueberries , carrots , chicken , cucumbers , dates , dietary guidelines , fish , fruit , green tea , ham , herbal tea , hibiscus tea , kidney beans , lettuce , meat , oregano , oxidative stress , peaches , peas , pork , poultry , seafood , sleep , smoking , spices , standard american diet , tea , tobacco , turkey , vegetables , watermelon - -
64	the reason we need more antioxidants glucose is the primary fuel of the human body . we consume glucose and breathe in oxygen to make the energy needed to power our bodies . plants then take the water and carbon dioxide we breathe out to make oxygen and organic compounds like glucose — and the circle of life continues . the word carbohydrate means , basically , hydrated carbon , which is what plants use to make carbs and all that ’ s left after we burn them for energy in our muscles and brain . this process of oxidizing glucose to make energy is messy , though , and generates free radicals . chugging sugar water increases the level of oxidation in our bloodstreams over the next few hours as our bodies metabolize the glucose . ( digestion isn ’ t the only physiological source of free radicals — exercise is too . see preventing exercise-induced oxidative stress with watercress ) . why would we evolve to have a negative reaction to our primary fuel ? because over the millions of years we evolved , there was no such thing as sugar water — all sugars and starches came pre-packaged with protective compounds : antioxidants . in nature , sugar always comes with phytonutrients . if we drink the same amount of sugar in the form of orange juice , we don ’ t get that spike in oxidation , because the sugar in fruit comes prepackaged with antioxidants . we can ’ t just drink vitamin c enriched sugar water either , because it ’ s not the vitamin c in the oj but the citrus phytonutrients like hesperetin and naringenin that beat back the oxidation . and it ’ s always better to eat the whole fruit than drink the juice ( see best fruit juice and apple juice may be worse than sugar water ) . if those citrus phytonutrients sounded familiar to you , it ’ s because i mentioned them before in videos like keeping your hands warm with citrus and reducing muscle fatigue with citrus . if we don ’ t eat phytonutrient-rich plant foods with each meal , then for hours after we eat , our bodies are tipped out of balance into a pro-oxidative state , which can set us up for oxidant stress diseases . that ’ s why we need to ideally eat antioxidant rich foods with every meal . in the video , minimum “ recommended daily allowance ” of antioxidants , we can see the levels of oxidized fat in our blood one , two , and three hours after sugar water ingestion , and the corresponding drop in vitamin e levels in our blood as our body ’ s antioxidant stores are being used up . if we don ’ t eat phytonutrient-rich foods with our meals , our body has to dip into its backup supply of antioxidants . we can ’ t get away with that for long . so while ideally we should stuff our faces with as many phytonutrient-rich foods as we can . in the very least we should eat enough antioxidants to counter the oxidation of digestion . we don ’ t want to slide backwards every day and end up with less antioxidants in our bodies than we woke up with . a chart in the video , minimum “ recommended daily allowance ” of antioxidants , shows the amount of antioxidants we need every day , depending on how much we eat , just to counter the oxidation of digestion . men in the u.s. average about 2500 calories a day and so should be getting at least 11,000 antioxidant units a day . women eat about 1800 calories and so should get at least 8,000 units just to stay solvent . however , the average american doesn ’ t even get half the minimum – no wonder oxidant stress related diseases abound . we ’ re getting so few antioxidants in our diet that we can ’ t even keep up with the free radicals created by merely digesting our meals . we are a nation in chronic oxidative debt . developed societies eat a lot of food but not enough plants , which could result in exaggerated and prolonged metabolic , oxidative , and immune imbalance . this presents opportunity for biological insult that over time could supersede our defense and repair systems , and manifest in cellular dysfunction , disease , and ultimately death . is there a refined sweetener that doesn ’ t cause free radical formation ? yes : erythritol may be a sweet antioxidant . what ’ s the best way of reaching our daily minimum of 8,000-11,000 antioxidant units a day ? that ’ s covered in my video how to reach the antioxidant “ rda “ . background on the role free radicals play in aging and disease can be found in my video mitochondrial theory of aging . antioxidant-rich diets can even change gene expression : plant-based diets and cellular stress defenses . historically , were not humans more adjusted and exposed to fasting … thus the need for far less anti-oxidants due to longer rests between eating for the human body ? is english your first language ? what ’ s the problem ? i am curious , why do you ask if english is my first language ? please let me know as i ’ d like to be aware of what i might be articulating via the written word that is grammatically incorrect . seriously , i ’ d appreciate the constructive criticism.over-focusing on grammatical correctness may be part of the problem , i think . clarity is important . that weird placement of an ellipsis in the middle of your original sentence is a sign that you can ’ t find clearly expressive syntax for posing your question ( s ) . a clause after the ellipsis largely repeats a clause before the ellipsis and together with some clunky diction contributes to a jumbled , confused feel . “ the human body ” is the thing that needs less anti-oxidants and that rests between eating , but you ’ ve shoved it to the end of the sentence so that this relationship is not clear as the sentence unfolds . this is a highly non-standard construction , and depending on how you systematize english grammar , probably an ungrammatical one as well . who talks about “ articulating via the written word ” when the essential idea is “ writing ” , anyway ? why so stiff and long-winded ? given that verbs make language move , how did you manage to construct half of your original question as a rambling noun clause ? thank you . i think the points you have made will benefit my writing in the future . seriously , i am grateful for your time and help.is there a reliable database that lists the antioxidant units contained in foods ? i am a regular user of the usda food database but so far have been unable to find any listing of antioxidant units on the database.i think i heard in one of dr. greger ’ s videos that the usda took that list down because it was being abused for marketing claims . i am not sure however , which video that was.melanie is right , the usda took their orac database down because of scientific as well as practical concerns , see : http : / / www.ars.usda.gov / services / docs.htm ? docid = 15866data published by the usda is in the public domain though , so it can still be ( legally ) found in the internet . this is the most recent official pdf version of the database : http : / / www.orac-info-portal.de / download / orac _ r2.pdfthe website http : / / oracvalues.com / provides the same usda data in a more easily accessible form.however , the concerns expressed by the usda panel , which lead to the withdrawal of the database , are to be taken seriously . simple , quantitative comparisons of different foods by their orac values are frankly silly – as the orac is only a crude and often misleading representation of a food ’ s physiological potency – and i am not particularly fond of dr. greger ’ s early videos doing such orac “ benchmarks ” .it ’ s literally comparing apples to oranges ( and of course much less related foods ) .that said , i think orac scores have some value for comparing similar foods with each other . if you have two brands of dark chocolate , for example , or two varieties of apples you can assume the one with the higher orac value to be the healthier choice.i would like to see food as a whole not as an antioxidant or whatever . but antioxidant levels seem to be dr. greger ’ s criteria for a healthy food . also , looking for that one food or nutrient that is going to be the answer to good health is not good health . too often the latest research is contradicted by tomorrows latest research.i ’ ve started doing periodic fasts ( 2-3 days in length ) . during each fast i ’ m obviously not ingesting antioxidants . is this enough of a problem to make fasting a questionable activity ? for your fluid intake how about you use lemon water or hibiscus tea to get some anti-o ’ s in ? not quite the amount that you actually need , but it surely is better than nothing.why do people keep saying glucose is the primary fuel ? it isn ’ t . over the course of any day , fat provides more energy . this is proven by the respiratory quotient which determines the relative burn of fat vs carbs . 100 % fat burning leads to a rq of 0.7 and carbs 1.0 . for the majority of people , rq is in the low 0.8s. it is a common teaching in physiology texts that for people not performing moderate or higher cardio exercise , 2 / 3s of energy comes from fat , and 1 / 3 from carbs , over the course of a day.this doesn ’ t change the need for anti-oxidants though , as fat and carb burning produce oxidants in large numbers.do such high fat foods like coconut flesh and nuts , and oils actually provide better energy and fuel to allow for intense exercise ? how about mental functioning ? this is interesting to me.glucose is primary brain fuel- doesn ’ t utilize fat / ketone bodies under normal circumstances . overall brain needs about 120 gm glucose / day ( about 400 calorie ) . fatty acids are not brain fuel- they are bound to albumin and do not cross blood brain barrier . fatty acids are not converted to glucose during prolonged starvation ketone bodies produced by liver partly replace glucose as fuel source . this is partially protein sparing . in absence of adequate carbohydrate ( brain fuel ) muscle broken down ( or ingested amino acids used ) to produce glucose in the liver . this called gluconeogenesis ( known as corey cycle when i took ap bio many many years ago ) .brain does not store glucose- must be continuously supplied . although brain glucose levels lower than plasma supply is steady . when plasma ( blood ) glucose drops below 2.2 mmol ( ~ 40 mg / dl ) neuronal injury / death ensues . glucose uptake / metabolism strongly correlated with functional activity in specific brain regions- more active region is the more glucose burned and higher blood flow to that region is . this demonstrated by various imaging modalities ( cnmri , pet scans ) . interestingly , although glucose metabolism higher in localized metabolically active regions , overall brain metabolism does not change much.muscle glycogen primary fuel source first several minutes of moderate-intense physical activity . for aerobic activities fatty acids primary fuel source for mild to light moderate intensity activity ( upto 60 % vo2 max ) can use % of maximal hr as rough estimate of vo2 max for individual . above this level carbohyrate becomes predominate energy source . at vo2 > 80 % max carbohydrate is almost entire fuel source- fats and amino acids just don ’ t come into play . after about 2 hours ( give / take ) of moderate to heavy aerobic activity carbohydrates virtually sole energy source . they usually need to be repleted as body will have exhausted liver and muscle glycogen.simple sugar in liquid ( about 5 % concentration ) with electrolytes and citrate optimal for prolonged high intensity aerobic activity in which energy , electrolytes and water must be replaced . commercial products available but i find diluting oj with water ( 50 : 50 ) works great and provides similar composition to commercial products.trent you ’ ve just rehashed a couple of situations where glucose is a primary energy substrate … .and totally ignored ‘ total ’ daily energy substrate composition . i suggest you keep googling until you get a more complete picture.bruce , my post was to “ guest ” response ; specifically , questions about mental functioning and fuel for intense exercise . “ guest ” did not inquire about total daily energy substate composition.energy substrate utilization complex and varied by organ system , activity level , and food composition.key points : 1 . skeletal muscle primarily utilizes fatty acid substrates at rest and low intensity physical activity . 2 . skeletal muscle almost exclusively utilizes glucose at more intense levels of physical activity . 3 . in addition to activity level rq is effected by composition of diet . 4 . brain exclusively uses glucose except during starvation or carbohydrate insufficiency.a “ complete ” picture of whole body and individual organ metabolism is beyond the scope of this forum . googling can be helpful to find informationberg jm , tymoczko jl , stryer l. biochemistry . 5th edition . new york : w h freeman ; 2002 . section 30.2 each organ has a unique metabolic profile http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / books / nbk22436 / best wishes , trent erney , m.d. , m.s.during intense exercise we utilize mostly carbohydrates for our energy bursts . carbohydrates found in ( whole grains , fruit , starchy vegetables ) provide our muscle cells with glucose ( energy ) . top athletes consume high carb diets to provide their body ’ s with an optimal amount of energy throughout their competitions . research continues to show that athletes on high carb diets perform better then their low carb counterparts . we use fats during low-intermediate forms of exercise such as walking , or light jogging , however obtaining healthy fats from nuts , and avocados are essential to an overall healthy diet.cameron seguraso for the people who consistently get less than the daily recommended amount of antioxidants , what is happening to them ? they seem to be still very much alive despite the fact that they may have less antioxidants in their bodies than they woke up with . i have a friend who eats a lot of meat with little antioxidant containing foods and he seems to be doing fine so far.they are aging and getting chronic disease . look around.no other sweetener killed the fruit flies fruit flies were also subjected to feeding tests with sucrose and corn syrup , but those sweeteners didn ’ t kill them . only erythritol had this effect , as it shown in the chart below : learn more : http : / / www.naturalnews.com / 045450 _ truvia _ erythritol _ natural _ pesticide.html # ixzz3kq77nyehso better avoid erythritol if you are a fruit fly .

65	how avoiding eggs could help you avoid diabetes type 2 diabetes is becoming a global pandemic . we know the consumption of eggs is related to the development of some other chronic diseases , what about diabetes ? there appears to be a stepwise increase in risk as more and more eggs are consumed . one study found that eating just a single egg a week increased the odds of diabetes by 76 % . two eggs a week doubled the odds , and an egg a day tripled the odds . recent studies , profiled in my video eggs and diabetes , have confirmed the link . in 2009 , harvard researchers found that a single egg a day or more was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women . this finding has since been confirmed in asia in 2011 and in europe in 2012 . reducing egg consumption should start early in life , though , as it appears once we get into our 70s , it may be too late . for those with diabetes , eggs may then hasten our death . eating one egg or more a day appears to shorten anyone ’ s lifespan , but may be even worse for those with diabetes , potentially doubling all-cause mortality , meaning egg-eating diabetics seem to live particularly short lives . this is not good news for the egg industry . from a transcript of a closed meeting i got through the freedom of information act , one egg industry advisor said , “ given the rate at which obesity and incidence of type ii diabetes is growing in the us , any association between dietary cholesterol and type ii diabetes could be a ‘ showstopper ’ that could overshadow the positive attributes in eggs . ” more freedom of information act insights into the egg industry can be found in : flax seeds may help control blood sugars ( flaxseeds for diabetes ) as well as indian gooseberries ( amla versus diabetes ) , but our best bet may be a diet composed entirely of plants ( how to prevent diabetes and how to treat diabetes ) . what horse dung ! i have chickens , am 68 years old and eat over 20 eggs a week . i ’ m 5 ’ 8 ″ at 160 pounds and my combined cholesterol number is under 200 . i don ’ t doubt that eggs have cholesterol but the link to type 2 is certainly not primary . type 2 diabetes is wide spread because most americans have bad diets and get little exercise . with the amount of fast food we consume and the fact that most of us get out of breath climbing a single flight of stairs eggs are the least of our worries.having cholesterol lower than “ normal ” in a world where normal cholesterol is much higher than it should be is not a selling point for eggs.imagine if everyone smoked , and you said that your lungs were only a quarter-filled with tar while everyone ’ s lungs are three-quarters filled with tar , so what you smoke is better than what they smoke . sure , it ’ s better that they ’ re not almost full , but the fact that there ’ s any tar in your lungs is a bad thing.smoking and cholesterol consumption are two totally different things … we need cholesterol , we don ’ t need cigarettes . “ cholesterol is so important to the body that it makes it itself — mother nature doesn ’ t leave it up to humans to get whatever they need from diet alone . so even if you ate a completely cholesterol-free diet , your body would make the approximately 1,000 mg it needs to function properly . ” http : / / www.health.harvard.edu / newsweek / understanding _ cholesterol.htmcholesterol levels are a meaningless measure of mortality but homocysteine is.every point above 6 is a 10 % extra risk of premature death ( and alzheimer ’ s ) . the other absolute measure is heart rate variability ( hrv ) . the moral of the story is whatever you eat or lifestyle you live that elevates these numbers is stealing your future.my comment was more directed to the fact that one doesn ’ t need to consume dietary cholesterol , but can synthesize the required amounts.the factors you listed are certainly important , but i don ’ t know if you can totally dismiss cholesterol levels , since from what i ’ ve read , no-one in the long-running framingham heart study with a total cholesterol level of 150 or below has ever had a heart attack . most doctors still seem to put some stock in them as well.cholesterol is a critical nutrient and as you say manufactured by the body . since the human body does not make mistakes it is never guilty of killing us . cholesterol does not load the gun nor does it pull the trigger . we choose to put unnatural stuff in our mouths and commit suicide . the high cholesterol was simply our bodies last ditched attempt to protect us . i disagree with michael greger regarding whole grains ( and all high gi foods ) but he is on the nail with animal products.the idea that it is safe to ingest things that the body makes for itself is unfounded . cows milk for example is loaded with estrogen , this doesn ’ t mean ingesting estrogen is a good idea even if you body needs estrogen.yes , mike … i agree ! i guess i stated that so it sounds like i was saying we need to eat it . we don ’ t but it doesn ’ t hurt to eat it either : ) correct and it can ’ t make cholesterol without fat.do you even understand they were making an analogy ? that is where you are wrong , i think you should make google your best friend after that remark.well high cholesterol isn ’ t necessarily bad . in fact their is data that suggest low cholesterol leads to even greater death.it ’ s complicated . we all need cholesterol otherwise we would indeed die.we have all been taught hdl is good cholesterol and ldl is bad cholesterol . well that ’ s simply wrong . we need we require both of them to remain alive.the real enemy is arterial inflammation . what damages or arteries is sugars and carbohydrates because we clearly find inflammatory markers when they are present . cholesterol is like a roadways asphalt patch work . it ’ s designed to coat internal vessels to repair damage from inflamation.the problem is ldl small particulates can stick to the inside vessel where inflammation has damages the blood vessel . small prticulate ldl will keep building up on a damages interior wall of a blood vessel . large ldl particle don ’ t do this sticking action to the cell … so it ’ s harmless.the key is to reduce blood vessel inflammation . aspirin helps some , but so do many foods . fat lower small particulate ldl , fat increases hdl & large particulate ldl . your over all ldl will likely go up , but it goes up with an increase in both hdl ( good ) & large ldl ( good ) cholesterol with a reduction of small ldl ( bad ) cholesterol . your over all cholesterol may rise but it ’ s due to improvements in your overall cholesterol.search foods that are high in inflammatory categories and eat them in plenty . parsley , dark green veggies and herbs work wonders here . use fats wisely to pull greater nutrition from your greens & to benefit from increasing hdl and reducing small particulate ldl … eggman : i ’ m sorry to hear about your cholesterol number . it ’ s my understanding that many heart attacks occur for people who have between 150 and 200 for total cholesterol . to be heart-attack proof , you need to be under 150 . if you want to improve your cholesterol numbers , you could try giving up the eggs along with all other animal foods – and possibly avoid type 2 diabetes at the same time . it ’ s a win-win.i agree that type 2 is on the rise because of bad diet . but as we have seen here , that bad diet includes eggs.good luck.thea , you seem like an earnest vegan but you need not worry about me . at 68 i ’ ve already beaten the odds especially since i have no chronic conditions for which i require drugs . regarding the subject of eggs the latest research from , for instance , harvard medical school states that dietary cholesterol is not the problem but saturated and trans fats . eggs have been vindicated and are considered an important source of just about everything our body needs for good health . please , eat some meat ( or eggs ) . not only will you live longer life will be worth living . besides , diet is only half the picture . i have been doing eastern exercise for over 43 years ( no , not yoga … never yoga ) .many people get to 68 just fine only to find that their health starts to crumble from cardiovascular disease in the next decade of life . i fear for some of my loved ones who are now traveling down exactly this sort of path.dietary cholesterol to the tune of 3 egg yolks a day is likely to be at least 10mg / dl of ldl according to hopkins ’ meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials — and i ’ m giving you a very conservative estimate because i don ’ t recall the exact model parameters off the top of my head and i want to leave some leeway for various other margins for error , such as your claim that you are less susceptible to cardiovascular upset by virtue of genes or other aspects of lifestyle.http : / / www.ibcmt.com / 2009-03-16-effectsofdietarycholesterolonserumcholesterol-paulhopkins.pdfeggs also contain saturated fat as well as cholesterol . 3 eggs per day is about 4.9 g / day of saturated fat from eggs alone :

fats-and-oils-aha-recommendation _ ucm _ 316375 _ article.jspany other fatty food or oil that you consume will likely bump up your percentage of calories from saturated fat , since most fats in food are a mixture of many fatty acids , including saturated fats.for someone who implies that he engages in a form of exercise which helps to straighten the mind as well as the body , i find it amusing that your words are also implying that life is only worth living with meat ( or eggs ) . what a petty view of life that would be ! i ’ m glad i amuse you and thanks for the uninformed assessment of someone you know nothing about . there are really only two reasons for being a vegan since that is what this thread is really all about . there is the fearful obsession with one ’ s own mortality – pathetic at best and the displaced love of animals – usually caused by the withholding of parental love . you also lost the broader irony of my comment to eat eggs . stop being afraid.you are reading into my feelings and eating practices a bit speculatively , and i think i have shown myself to be at least somewhat informed about the risks that may come from egg consumption ; more than you , at any rate . your original comment rests upon the assumption that you value health and lifespan . should we call that ‘ obsessive ’ and wildly speculate that it ’ s due to the withholding of parental or matrimonial love or something ? you ’ re called ‘ eggman ’ , for crying out loud . you don ’ t think you have a few biases of your own to contend with in this topic area ? it seems to me that your identity is a bit bound up with the practice of eating eggs.for every web site you can find that claims eggs are the devil i can find one that says they ’ re a “ super-food ” and an important addition to any diet . the harvard medical school is firmly in my camp and even the usually conservative mayo clinic cautiously optimistic about eggs . you ’ re not well informed – you ’ ve just chosen a side.actually , you ’ re fairly easy to read . you pontificate about a subject that is far from decided in the scientific or medical community . and let ’ s talk handles : i ’ ve been “ eggman ” for the length of this thread . the site wanted a log-in and i thought it funny considering the subject . but “ largelytrue ” ! you ’ ve obviously set yourself up as an authority on a number of subjects . i can ’ t imagine how tiresome you must be in a social situation . it would be wrong to assume that my original comments indicate that i overly value health and lifespan . i was a career marine so how long i was going to live was never a convenient or sought after subject . i was making the point that eggs have been with me a good long time with no deleterious effect . no sub text there.your addition of “ matrimonial love ” to my statement was also telling and uncomfortably revealing . you write like a woman so i ’ m guessing that you have some issues of your own at home.i think we can both agree that this exchange is deteriorating and soon it will be “ f _ _ k you ” or words to that effect . not wishing to go there i ’ ll ask you not to bother replying because i will not receive it . instead i ’ ll move on and leave you to the pseudo -science of the site.you were calling statistical research “ horse dung ” because you look at yourself and find that you are not on meds yet . this is like saying that climate change is not occurring because it was a hot day today where you are . it invokes reasoning that is ignorant of the general meaning of the science which it is commenting upon.this site is indeed not without its biases . it ’ s a weak scientific authority in general compared to peer-reviewed research because it is basically one doctor ’ s attempt at easily-consumed public health communication on matters nutritional . but a whole-food plant based diet is not that far removed from being the concensus view of ‘ optimal ’ diet in a complicated debate on diet , which is complicated for many reasons , not least of which being that many disciplines try to claim authority over the discussion , and that ‘ optimal ’ often turns out to be somewhat of an ambiguous word when groups make recommendations . limiting dietary cholesterol is a goal of the cdc , the whmay , might , maybe , possibly are not worss of wisdom or reasons to follow … the longest fast clinically tracked was a man over 500 lbs that lost 276 lbs eating absolutely nothing for 383 days . his health only go better and better and blood work improved week after week etc . are we to assume water & air is nutritious ? why know , but we could deduce his body consuming nothing but his pure fat stores was indeed healthy and beneficial.i ’ m not aware of any studies where egg only diets were assessed to determine the effects on serum levels … but an eggs is 6g protein , .5g carbohydrate , and 5g fat . it ’ s borderline ketogenic , or more atkins-genic … .lol. it doesn ’ t cause the pancreas to secrete insulin , it doesn ’ t raise glucose … there is a claim via questionaires studies eggs * may * cause it because some scientists see a coorelation on how people responded in survey … i ’ d be more concerned if a study with rats or pigs fed nothing but eggs were to develop type2 diabetes … but again no such studies . or a control group of nondiabetic people eating nothing but eggs for 2 weeks with blood tests validating a relation exists.personally i want to be there to watch my kids grow up and be well enough to help them care for their children . if that constitutes a pathetic fear of my own mortality i ’ ll take it . just went through watching my 70 year old father go through double by pass surgery and worsening diabetes . he eats pretty much the same way you do for pretty much the same reasons . i hope you make it to 100 , but most people that eat the way you describe don ’ t . if they ’ re lucky they live the last 15 years of their life struggling to walk across the wal mart parking lot . hopefully your love of exercise and good genes will see you through . “ harvard medical school states that dietary cholesterol is not the problem but saturated and trans fats ” three eggs contain : 4.7 g saturated fat , 0.1 g trans fatno , you will not live longer by consuming animals and their by-products , that will only kill you quicker ! it ’ s a proven fact that vegans tend to live much longer and healthier lives on a plant-based diet because that is what we are intended to ingest . if you consume animals , you are turning your stomach into a graveyard and the statements holds true , “ you are what you eat ” … well if you keep eating death then you are only committing suicide . like you said , you ’ ve beaten the odds … for now ! nicole , some things to consider when determining what we are “ intended to ingest ” .1 . meat consumption kick-started civilization : early hominids found a competitive niche when they began to capitalize on an ability to digest and derive sustenance from meat . however , the meat they could catch by themselves couldn ’ t sustain them especially in cooler climes where edible vegetation wasn ’ t always available . they had to learn to cooperate with other individuals to bring down game of sufficient size . this supplied greater protein for the group and allowed it to grow in size and complexity . it also eventually freed some for pursuits besides hunting and gathering . if early hominids had been vegans we ’ d still be scrambling in the grass for nuts , berries and the occasional beetle , and it would be dinner without a movie.2. vegetables are the original cause of most intergroup warfare : in hunter-gatherer societies when a group encountered a numerically superior group they would just retreat since there was always someplace else to hunt and gather . if they kept any domestic animals they just brought them along . one day somebody discovered that some of the plants they gathered could be cultivated and agriculture began . however , after taking the time to plant a field and wait around for the harvest too much was invested to retreat if another group came calling . the only alternative was to fight in defense of the land . in essence , plant cultivation is the root cause of the large scale expression of territorial behavior in humans.please consider this when you ’ re feeling morally superior about being a vegan . for support of these ideas and to see what growing your precious vegetables has done to the planet see the below link.http : / / www.theecologist.org / investigations / food _ and _ farming / 268902 / humanitys _ worst _ invention _ agriculture.htmldear sir : thanks for your message on eggs . my grandmother used as therapy and her patients in catmon , cebu , philippines & argao , cebu , philippines . the patients did not become diabetic . i am 69 years old and with no diabetes . and i ate plenty off eggs even until now.a t 160 pounds your height you must be fat , since i ’ m myself your height but i weigh 130 only and still think i got some junk in my trunk . must be all those eggs making you so heavy.veganchick , i ’ m guessing by your handle that you ’ re female . i am not . the degree of muscle density is much different between us . for a woman you sound about right at 130 – even a bit husky if you ’ re under 5 ’ 8 ″ . however , if you were a man i ’ d say start lifting something heavier than a veggiburger . check the life insurance tables to better understand what people should weigh.actually diabetes has nothing to do with eggs outside of poor coorelation studies . the citation here are mostly based on questionaires and that ’ s not great science.also it ’ s not true that regular exercise would cure type2 diabetes . a 600lb obese person has bariatric surgery and in days or weeks they are cured of their diabetes in 95 % of cases . they are still fat , they aren ’ t exercising but their diabetes is gone ? high blood sugar isn ’ t diabetes . it ’ s a symptom of diabetes . the cause is excess carbohydrate and sugars and a fat created only when our bodies are storing excess energy as body fat . so it ’ s a disease of a dietary nature only caused in the presence of excess energy we consume in carbohydrates.the disease is in fact a cause of excess insulin secretion . it ’ s a metabolic disorder whereby person secretes way to much insulin than is normally required to keep glucose levels normal.you get your sugar checked by your doctor . he say ahhh your fine your glucose is 99 . you think wow ! gres i ’ m fine … what doesn ’ t your know ? he doesn ’ t know if you ’ re secreting 3x the amount of insulin to maintain that 99 level … i believe all doctors need to perform fasting glucose readings on patients . if you fall out side of a normal range of insulin its an indicator you are genetically predisposed to diabetes . this would also give you time to adress your eating habits to limit sugar spikes and insulin spike before your disease grows out of control.i would like to ask dr greger on how to increase testosterone production without ( or very low ) saturated fat / cholesterol . everywhere i research it seems to be the general consensus that to increase testosterone production ( along with better sleep , more zinc / magnesium / vitamin d and such ) it really starts with building the testosterone from cholesterol / saturated fats . is there any way to increase testosterone levels while limiting / replacing cholesterol ( or at least balance its negative effects with something else ) .thank you for any clarity / information on the subject ! go vegan.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 02 / 12 / less-cancer-in-vegan-men-despite-more-testosterone / try researching sauna usage to increase testosterone ! ! ! green eggs ! i recently started blending two egg whites with a handful of spinach , broccoli or broccoli sprouts and then scrambling them . you never mention anything about egg whites . do you consider eggs whites bad too ? tom : here is what i share with people when they ask about egg whites : there are two problems with eggs , the yolk and the white . ( to paraphrase dr. barnard . ) with egg whites , the cholesterol issue is not in play . but egg whites are just as bad for you . dr. barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health . other experts talk about the ( strong in my opinion ) link between animal protein and cancer . the question scientists then want to answer is : is there a causal link ? if so , what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer ? if memory serves , dr campbell in the china study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer . here on nutritionfacts , you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body ’ s over-production of a growth hormone called igf-1 . igf-1 helps cancer to grow . to watch the series about igf-1 , click on the link below and then keep clicking the “ next video ” link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video . then you will have seen the entire series. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop / and darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue . egg whites have * the * highest concentration of methionine of any food : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000084000000000000000.html ? categories = 1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 dr. greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer . so , there are two clear pathways linking animal proteins , especially egg whites , to cancer. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / darryl also pointed out that , “ … high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans . in its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders , homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit , excess methionine . ” http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0939475305001092and while i can ’ t find it right now , i believe that toxins has pointed out two other health issues with egg whites.with all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular , i think it ’ s best to stay away from egg white . why not get your protein from safe sources ? sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein ? ( ie : whole plant foods ) make sense ? i ’ m completely confused by this information … and please no one call me an idiot for that ! is this correlation between eggs and dmii because people are eating processed foods along with those eggs ? because dietary cholesterol is necessary for so many processes in our bodies and if we are only getting cholesterol from sources like eggs instead of processed foods / carbs / sugar then then our bodies will benefit from it . we make our own cholesterol especially if we avoid it dietarily and we make extra cholesterol out of these processed foods and if we eat too much of them we end up with high cholesterol overall . i ’ ve known people that avoided dietary cholesterol completely and still had to be on statins because if not their cholesterol would be in greater than 500 ! i have always eaten eggs and meat and saturated fat-i am not paleo-but was just raised on food like that along with vegetables and my total cholesterol has always been 170 ’ s with triglycerides in the 50 ’ s and hdl between 70-92 ! those numbers equate to a very low risk for heart disease . i have never worried about saturated fat in my diet.i like to read about nutrition and health but i am so exhausted from all the conflicting information that gets put out there by people depending on their personal opinions and letting that dictate what they think people should eat and what information they think is valuable that they put out there for others etc . i am going to keep eating intuitively and stop buying into or reading about all the opinionated information / studies out there . “ studies ” mean nothing to me . they can be skewed by all kinds of things no matter now systematic they are because we are human . eat what works for you individually.the egg components responsible for the association between egg intake and diabetes could be the high methionine protein , high levels of arachidonic acid , or the high choline content . it may also be some complex interaction mediated by gut microbiota , as suggested for choline and cvd . • divergent associations of plasma choline and betaine with components of metabolic syndrome in middle age and elderly men and women ( 2008 ) • dietary patterns , food groups , and nutrients as predictors of plasma choline and betaine in middle-aged and elderly men and women ( 2008 ) • gut flora metabolism of phosphatidylcholine promotes cardiovascular disease ( 2014 ) at the moment , all we have is the repeated association of egg intake with diabetes , and cvd in diabetics , in studies from diverse cultures ( and background risks ) . only recently have many humans lived long enough , on rich enough diets , to experience the long-term harms of nutrient excess in chronic disease risk , and the precise mechanisms aren ’ t always as well characterized as those for nutrient deficiencies.i am experiencing the same thing . i read dr. greger , joel fuhrman , and neal barnard , and they say don ’ t eat meat , milk , eggs or we ’ ll get fat , diabetes , heart problems . then i read dr. perlmutter , dr. masley , dr. mercola and others , who say the problem is our brains will atrophy , we will get diabetes and alzheimers if we eat grains and don ’ t eat enough fat . the latter group always says to eat organic pastured and non-gmo which i do . it ’ s so expensive that i can ’ t eat much of it , so i guess that ’ s my compromise . lots of veggies and fruit , some grains ( less wheat / gluten ) , low to moderate healthy fat and very little free range organic pastured non -gmo meat / eggs / yogurt , etc . i don ’ t have time to sift through each study . i have work and children to raise so i guess this is the best i can figure out what to do . johnneal barnard is someone you should trust , he does actual research , publishes papers in peer reviewed journals and does extensive clinical trials . he more than most has the actual proof to back up his claims . likewise dr john mcdougall , dr caldwell esselstyn and dr dean ornish.i ’ d love to see some credible evidence supporting the outrageous claims the ‘ grain brainers ’ make.it ’ s easy to be confused . after all , that ’ s why the egg industry pays for “ confounding studies . ” many of the same folks who brought us ads that smoking is good for us ( doctors choose lucky strikes , ) have been seeing checkbook-science claims about the killer foods . just to be clear , no dietary cholesterol is necessary for people . your liver makes all you need . check out this video : [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims / ] . ( just to clarify , there is no dietary requirement for cholesterol . your liver makes all the cholesterol you need . ) who knows what those people in the study were eating along with their eggs … .corn tortillas ? toast ? english muffins ? processed meats ? donuts ? potatoes ? sugar in one form or another ? i.e : everything i just listed prior to sugar . i don ’ t agree with any study that just tweaks or looks at one part of someones diet and doesn ’ t take into consideration anything else they are putting into their mouths.feel free to come up with your own study . i ’ d love to see the results.my study is on myself han . so far i can ’ t complain and i have never been worried about saturated fat or fat at all for that matter ( monounsaturated , saturated , medium chain triglycerides ) in my diet at all ( i do not however , consume soy , canola , or vegetable oils , etc ) and i have the very lowest risk of heart disease every time i have ever had my lab drawn . i am one of those people who believe that fat does not make us fat.big companies pay to have “ studies ” done on their products and drugs and what not and we just trust that whatever the results of those studies are must be correct . that is just naive . my point is , if you are doing a study on people who you tell to add one egg a week or one a day or whatever … .. it really matters what else they are consuming . wouldn ’ t you say that makes sense ? ? ? what i believe ( and i am also a registered nurse ) is that the number one thing that raises triglycerides and cholesterol / ldl levels in the blood is excess sugar … whether it is bread or potatoes or rice or processed , packaged non-foods , it is all sugar to your body and when your body runs out of cell space to shuttle that glucose into that sugar is then made into fat and excess cholesterol . period.well then by all means : produce a study that proves these _ beliefs _ and publish the results.you shouldn ’ t equate processed sugar with whole plant based carbohydrates , they are very different things in terms of how they affect your health and body . at the very least you need to acknowledge the importance of fiber in natural foods along with all the other nutrients . nature made us like sweet things because in their natural state those foods that taste sweet have what we thrive on . starch rich grains and tubers have been the staple foods of all the world ’ s most successful populations and in whole form they ’ ve consistently been shown to be good for your health.it so easy to throw number … … … … … … i want to see the real study … … . i personally saw study that said the opposite of this gentlement … … … … . it so easy to scare people … . eating egg is like eating chocolate or meat or carrots or fish or else … … diversity is the word … .. for example : eating carrots is good but eating 20 pound a week it maybe too much … . as your apetite will go smaller then you eat less other meals ( meat / fish / vege / fruit / weats ) then your body may miss important thing for your health … … .. as always , links to the “ real study ” are included . you can find them at “ sources cited . ” there are studies that show otherwise , but here ’ s the trick , cholesterol consumption has a plateau effect so that up to a certain level of consumption it increases morbidity then there is a saturation point beyond which further consumption has little additional effect . the egg board has been notable in publishing such studies that show people on already high cholesterol diets can eat eggs without further increasing their health risks , they neglect to mention that these people are already at high risk of heart disease and would do better to change their diet as soon as possible.looks like the dairy , eggs & meat triple death foundations are infiltrating nutritionfacts judging by these less than insightful comments.it means they are really worried . which is a good thing.worried about what exactly ? go rea
69	does caramel color cause cancer ? used as a coloring agent in products ranging from colas and beer to gravies and soy sauce , caramel coloring may be the world ’ s most widely consumed food coloring . it helps grocery stores sell more than a billion servings of food and beverages a day . unfortunately , the manufacturing of certain artificial caramel colorings can lead to the formation of carcinogens such as 4-methylimidazole , which causes cancer in mice but not rats ( or at least , not male rats ) . however , it is unclear whether humans are more like mice or rats in terms of their response to the carcinogen . to be safe , california officially listed it as a carcinogen and started requiring warning labels on soft drinks containing more than 29 micrograms per serving . the soft drink industry was unsuccessful in opposing the action , so they were forced to reduce carcinogen levels in their products — but only in california . buy coke anywhere else , and it may have up to five times the limit ( see is caramel color carcinogenic ? ) . there ’ s another class of additives that the soda industry uses to make its soda brown ( see phosphate additives in meat purge and cola ) . there are other harmful additives in soda as well ( is sodium benzoate harmful ? and diet soda and preterm birth ) . similarly the junk food industry uses titanium dioxide to whiten processed foods ( titanium dioxide & inflammatory bowel disease ) . the meat industry has also used potentially toxic additives for cosmetic purposes such as arsenic-containing drugs ( arsenic in chicken ) and phosphate additives in chicken to make poultry pink . carbon monoxide is used to keep red meat red , and acanthoxanthins keep salmon pink ( artificial coloring in fish ) . it ’ s amazing the risks the food industry will take to alter appearances ( artificial food colors and adhd ) . well this has a simple fix – if it has a label put it back on the shelf ! yes , great point – broccoli doesn ’ t have a label … you carry a lot of influence with your patients , i am sure . please suggest they avoid all supplements and “ vegan health foods ” snacks / vegan ice-creams / cheeses / yougurts / cookies / soy milks etc. that contain titanium dioxide . sooner or later ‘ whole foods market ” will get the message and stop carrying products that contain titanium dioxide . they already prohibit certain products because of other seemingly less harmful ingredients.good point . in my opinion – for what it is worth – a mostly plant based diet 95-98 % ( with an occasional piece of meat or cheese ) is much better than a junk based vegan diet . the key word is wfpd 95-98 % of the time.agreed. one of the most sensible , fair and realistic comments i ’ ve read . thank you . “ similarly the junk food industry uses titanium dioxide to whiten processed foods ( titanium dioxide & inflammatory bowel disease ) . ” the “ healthy vegan food product industry ” and the “ vitamin industry ” also use titanium dioxide , at times in their products . we fortunately have labels on products to give us the heads up to avoid these products.the use of titanium dioxide by vitamin manufactures — in the capsules mostly — is mind-numbingly stupid.as ever the informed consumer must read labels and * not purchase * from offending ‘ health ’ companies.off topic : are amino acid supplements safe for vegans ? i sometimes struggle to absorb / benefits ( it seems ) from beans , grains , nuts , seeds . i know some people take coconut aminos but i doubt this product contains enough amino acids to make a positive difference ( i could be wrong ) . i am on a path hoping to be 100 percent vegan but have had to partake in a bit of shellfish to survive , as far as strength , protein / amino acids , b12 . fyi … . might add , i fully agree that there are 100 percent vegans who thrive , excel , and have no need at all to ingest non-plant foods.so , i have biig concerns about supplemental amino acids , as to what this could do harmfully / unnaturally to the body . any science available on this ? but i am willing to give it a try if the science suggests it is ok to proceed.in the gmo articles dr. greger dismissed animal studies . so why bring them up here ? they are obviously of no use for humans if there are carcinogenic in mice , but not in male rats. artificial colors , beer , beverages , california , cancer , caramel color , carcinogens , coca cola , food additives , gravy , industry influence , pepsi , safety limits , soda , soy sauce - -
70	we can end the heart disease epidemic many of the diseases that are common in united states are rare or even nonexistent in populations eating mainly whole plant foods . these so-called western diseases are some of our most common conditions : these diseases are common in the west , but are rarities among plant-based populations . a landmark study in 1959 i profiled in my video cavities and coronaries : our choice , for example , suggested that coronary heart disease was practically non-existent among those eating traditional plant-based diets in uganda . “ doctors in sub-saharan africa during the ‘ 30s and ‘ 40s recognized that certain diseases commonly seen in western communities were rare in rural african peasants . this hearsay talk greeted any new doctor on arrival in africa . even the teaching manuals stated that diabetes , coronary heart disease , appendicitis , peptic ulcer , gallstones , hemorrhoids , and constipation were rare in african blacks who eat foods that contain many skins and fibers , such as beans and corn , and pass a bulky stool two or three times a day . surgeons noticed that the common acute abdominal emergencies in western communities were virtually absent in rural african peasants . ” but did they have hard data to back it up ? yes . major autopsy series were performed . in one thousand kenyan autopsies , there were “ no cases of appendicitis , not a single heart attack , only three cases of diabetes , one peptic ulcer , no gallstones , and no evidence of high blood pressure ” ( which alone affects one out of three americans ) . maybe the africans were just dying early of other diseases and so never lived long enough to get heart disease ? no . in the video one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic , you can see the age-matched heart attack rates in uganda versus st. louis . out of 632 autopsies in uganda , only one myocardial infarction . out of 632 missourians — with the same age and gender distribution — there were 136 myocardial infarctions . more than 100 times the rate of our number one killer . in fact , researchers were so blown away that they decided to do another 800 autopsies in uganda . still , just that one small healed infarct ( meaning it wasn ’ t even the cause of death ) out of 1,427 patients . less than one in a thousand , whereas in the u.s. , it ’ s an epidemic . if heart disease is so rare in rural africa , how do the local doctors even know what to look for ? though practically unheard of among the native population , the physicians are quite familiar with heart disease because of all the westerners that immigrate to the country . the famous surgeon dr. denis burkitt insisted that modern medicine is treating disease all wrong : “ a highly unacceptable fact — that is rarely considered yet indisputable — is that , with rare exceptions , there is no evidence that the incidence of any disease was ever reduced by treatment . improved therapies may reduce mortality but may not reduce the incidence of the disease . ” take cancer , for example , where the vast majority of effort is devoted to advances in treatment , and second priority is given to screening programs attempting early diagnosis . is there any evidence that the incidence of any form of cancer has been reduced by improved treatment or by early detection ? early diagnosis may reduce mortality rates , and medical services can have a profoundly beneficial effect on sick people , but neither have little ( if any ) effect on the number of people becoming ill . no matter how fancy heart disease surgery gets , it ’ s never going to reduce the number of people falling victim to the disease . dr. burkitt compared the situation to an engine left out in the rain : “ if an engine repeatedly stops as a consequence of being exposed to the elements , it is of limited value to rely on the aid of mechanics to detect and remedy the fault . examination of all engines would reveal that those out in the rain were stopping , but those under cover were running well . the correct approach would then be to provide protection from the offending environment . however , considering the failing engine as the ailing patient , this is seldom the priority of modern medicine . ” dr. burkitt sums it up with the analogy of the cliff or the ambulance : “ if people are falling over the edge of a cliff and sustaining injuries , the problem could be dealt with by stationing ambulances at the bottom or erecting a fence at the top . unfortunately , we put far too much effort into the provision of ambulances and far too little into the simple approach of erecting fences . ” and of course there are all the industries enticing people to the edge , and profiting from pushing people off . if all plant-based diets could do is reverse our number one killer , then shouldn ’ t that be the default diet until proven otherwise ? the fact that it also appears to reverse other leading killers like diabetes and hypertension appears to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming . so why doesn ’ t the medical profession embrace it ? it may be because of the tomato effect . why don ’ t many individual doctors do it ? it may be because lifestyle medicine hurts the bottom line ( see lifestyle medicine : treating the causes of disease ) . why doesn ’ t the federal government recommend it ? it may be because of the self-interest of powerful industries ( see the mcgovern report ) . but you can take your destiny into your own hands ( mouth ? ) and work with your doctor to clean up your diet and maximize your chances of living happily ever after . right on , dr. greger ! i am glad to see that you are getting this important message across in your tuesday / thursday articles in addition to your videos , because the major search engines such as google index text on web pages rather than imagery in videos . as much as i like your videos , i think the more often that you write about the concept of heart disease being preventable , the more likely that a search engine will deliver references to this concept on your website , and hopefully guide people towards better health.all of the videos have text transcripts luckily.ahhh the sweet taste of destinyi suspect that the us government would be more willing to protect the population against diet-related diseases if not for the fact that us-based mncs profit greatly from the selling of processed foods , and from beverages , most of which are clearly detrimental.even though americans are only 4 % of the global population , they own more than 50 % of all global market share , and , this disproportionate ownership has come to pass , in part , because the us government , and the fed , are enabling the process . naturally , the us government has always been supportive of private enterprise , but for the past few decades , it has been the aggressor in an all-out economic war . accordingly , very profitable mncs have been allowed to pay little or no taxes , and in most cases they are also subsidized . mncs are also the benefactors of the 780 military bases across the globe , and they benefit too from intelligence being gathered by the long list of intelligence agencies ( 17 ) . mncs have also received vast financial aid from zirp and qe , these programs allowing them to borrow cheaply at home so as to keep taxable profits from repatriating . thus , and all the way back to the ‘ petro-dollar fix ’ ( which keeps the dollar strong ) , the restructuring of the tax codes in the 1980s , and the stubborn reluctance to eliminate ag subsidies , and many other such efforts , the us government has become so intricately intertwined with big business that it is difficult to know where one starts and the other stops.my main point here being , that any admission by officials that any products being produced by us companies are suspect , is like an act of treason.thanks ray . clear , concise and illuminating points . no wonder so many of us are removing the blinkers that informed us from childhood that america is a good big brother . it seems greedy corporations have become a cancer across the globe.exactly , they are investing in early detection : find patients before they are so ill they can no longer be cured . but so ill they are willing to pay their life savings for some chemo therapy … it ’ s all about profits you know.the statistics remind me of mark twain ’ s admonition regarding statistics . for example , while uganda ’ s incidence of myocardial infarctions is far lower than missouri ’ s ( why missouri ? ) , it still doesn ’ t prove that ugandans are not dying of something else , perhaps due to their plant-based diet . perhaps their lack of animal based protein is leading to some other diseases . in other words , we are not getting the whole picture here . for example , there have been reports that the reason for the japanese obesity being so low compared to american obesity is because they eat white rice . hmmm . would it be pc to point to portion control as the real reason ? compare a bento box with tea versus a dinner plate filled with carbs , sugar , and soda.diet education ( by parents ) is a major concern , in relation to what you are talking about . i agree about portion control , and sadly most parents learn from their surroundings and their parents . the surroundings scream eat this big fat burger everywhere you go . society believes when you ’ ve been relegated to eating salad , you ’ re dieting , as well . those two things put together are huge . humans go the route of least resistance unfortunately : ( the head of alibaba jack ma interview with dave faber this morning reflected this view . in the interview jack suggested that in china , building hospitals and filling them with medical professionals is not the answer to health issues that are beginning to plague china . instead , clean water and air should be the goals . otherwise you are just enabling the problem.it seems the african diet does include meat ( see link below ) . so is an all plant based diet really the answer ? is it perhaps the amount of meat or lack of refined sugars in their diet ? if you eat an all plant based diet don ’ t you also need to take supplements of b12 and other nutrients ? it would be good to know just how much meat we need to eat to get all the nutrients we require . what is the rough percentage of meat consumed in the diets of the african communities that were studied ? http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / ugandan _ cuisinei think you can look at the traditional mediterranean diet especially de crete one ( which have very low cvd rates ) to have an idea ? two times fish a week and two small portions of poultry a week , red meat a couple of times a month.http : / / www.health.harvard.edu / blog / adopt-a-mediterranean-diet-now-for-better-health-later-201311066846the african diet pyramid looks close to this : http : / / oldwayspt.org / sites / default / files / images / african _ pyramid _ flyer.jpgi love the bottom half of that pyramid ! the greens being at the very bottom , the emphasis on herbs and spices as their own group , and the instructions to “ enjoy meals with others ” . thanks for sharing . : ) a diet that can reverse heart disease can obviously prevent it . a purely plant-based diet has proven to do this . does a diet that includes meat reverse heart disease ? i ’ m sure if it really could , the meat industry would be all over it.if you look at the mediterranean diet , progression on vascular problems of high risk patients . this is what it can do : “ intervention with a meddiet supplemented with 30 g / d of mixed nuts for a mean of 2.4 years induced regression of ica-imtmean and delayed the progression of both ica-imtmax and plaquemax , the ultrasound features that best predict future cvd events . although ica-imtmax and plaquemax progressed in the control group , there were no changes in the meddiet supplemented with evoo group . ” ( evoo = exra virgin olive oil ) http : / / atvb.ahajournals.org / content / 34 / 2 / 439.short so there can be some regression and for the rest stagnation of the process . seems pretty healthy to me . the good thing to see is that nuts can make a difference ! still not really good news for the meat-industry … because the amounts and portions of meat consumed on a meddiet are small . however dairy is consumed daily in moderate ammounts ( and of grazing cows / goats / sheep ) .that ’ s great info . thanks for the reply ! interesting , and i have nuts daily myself , but “ delayed the progression of both ica-imtmax and plaquemax ” to me implies progression is still occurring . i don ’ t think this is the case with a whole foods , no-oils , plant-based diet.it ’ s also called “ arrested progression ” in the article . for me it ’ s like … if my heart-health is ok … a meddiet is probably ok to eat for me . if arteries are clogged i would have to stick to a whole foods , no-oils , plant-based diet for a while.i wonder if there has ever been studies on regression of heart disease on a whole foods , high fat ( unsatureated ) , plant-based diet , a vegan meddiet so to say . because a low-fat version excludes nuts … and in this research it seems nuts had a very positive effect.the principle behind dr. dean ornish ’ s spectrum diet adheres to your thoughts in the first paragraph . basically you must go towards the healthful end of the spectrum to the degree your health ( or lack thereof ) requires . but as always , prevention is easier than cure.personally , i would find it hard to give up the satiation and the calories ( i ’ m slim ) that nuts provide.thank you dr.greger for bringing dr.burkit ’ s name to the light of this world again – what a doctor and scientist he was and even more god devoted father ! dr. burkitt certainly had extraordinary vision . one of my favorite burkitt sayings is , “ america is a constipated nation … . if you pass small stools , you have to have large hospitals . ” it ’ s funny but it ’ s true . when you think about it , fiber is only naturally found in plants . the more plants , the more fiber . so the total amount of naturally occurring fiber consumed from plants also indicates the level of consumption of minerals and phytonutrients packed with it . the higher the fiber , the less toxicity from animal products . so , your poop is a general gauge of high nutrient consumption as well [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2015 / 02 / 19 / dont-forget-fiber / ] .is there any information on diet and dementiayes – important message . i am an avid reader and sharer and promoter of nutritionfacts.org. but , the recent addition of the annoying message to subscribe to receive it in my mailbox daily , when i am already subscribed , and ( at least once ) have donated to support your work – needs some tweeking ! please do something about this … .pamycst : i forwarded your message onto the staff at nutritionfacts . just wanted to let you know that you message was heard .

71	how to prevent heart disease many of today ’ s lifestyle medicine doctors , myself included , were greatly influenced by nathan pritikin , the nutrition pioneer who started reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and exercise back in the 70s . ( more on nathan pritikin in engineering a cure , our number one killer can be stopped , and the answer to the pritikin puzzle . ) but how did he come up with the idea of opening up arteries without drugs or surgery ? we tend to think of rural china as a place with a fraction of our disease rates , but we may forget about africa . pritikin was 43 when he was told by his cardiologist that he was going to die from a heart attack , so he began to live on a diet patterned after the black population in uganda , a population living off plants that was essentially free from death from heart attacks . after curing his own heart disease with a plant-based diet , he went on to save the lives of thousands of others . what was the data that so convinced him ? last year , the international journal of epidemiology reprinted a landmark article from the ‘ 50s that started out with a shocking statement : “ in the african population of uganda , coronary heart disease is almost non-existent . ” our number one cause of death almost nonexistent ? what were they eating ? plantains and sweet potatoes , other vegetables , corn , millet , pumpkins , tomatoes , and “ green leafy vegetables are taken by all . ” their protein was almost entirely from plant sources , and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it , similar to modern-day plant-eaters . “ apart from the effects of diet and of the blood cholesterol levels , ” the researchers couldn ’ t figure out any other reasons for their freedom from heart disease . these fifty-year-old findings are still relevant today . they showed “ dietary intake to be a key , modifiable , established and well-recognized risk factor for heart attacks . this contrasts with the rather desperate search in recent decades for even newer cardiovascular risk factors . ” we have the only risk factor we need — cholesterol . we ’ ve known it for 50 years , and we can do something about it . see one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic . as you can see in the video cavities and coronaries : our choice , according to the editor-in-chief of the american journal of cardiology , the only risk factor required for atherosclerotic plaques to form is elevated ldl , or “ bad ” cholesterol in our blood . dr. william clifford roberts is the distinguished cardiac pathologist who doubles as the editor-in-chief of the american journal of cardiology . more from him in eliminating the # 1 cause of death and heart attacks and cholesterol : purely a question of diet . to drop our ldl cholesterol , we need to drop our intake of three things : trans fat ( found in junk food and animal foods – see trans fat in meat and dairy ) ; saturated fat ( found in mostly animal foods ) ; and dietary cholesterol ( found exclusively in animal foods ) . more on lowering ldl in trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero . what dr. shaper discovered is that heart disease may be a choice . like cavities . people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush pretty much had no cavities . didn ’ t brush a day in their lives , never flossed , no listerine , no waterpik — and yet , no cavities . why ? because candy bars hadn ’ t been invented yet ! so why do people continue to get cavities when we know they ’ re preventable though diet ? simple : because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist . as long as people understand the consequences of their actions , as a physician what more can i do ? if you ’ re an adult and decide that the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family , then go for it — i certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence ( i ’ ve got a good dental plan ! ) . but what if instead of the plaque on our teeth , we ’ re talking about the plaque building up in our arteries ? then we ’ re no longer just talking about scraping tarter . we ’ re talking life and death . the most likely reason our loved ones will die is heart disease . it ’ s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live , but we should make our choices consciously , educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions . thank you dr. greger . another great summary . i am forwarding this to all of my family members.yes , i concur with veganrunner — another great blog post . thank you , dr. g ! i do have one question , though : are you saying that it would be wise , or at least possible , to abstain from brushing and flossing were we to abstain in turn from candy , soda , cakes , and the like ? see , i eat a mostly whole foods plant based diet — all i eat that ’ s not a “ whole food ” is a slice of whole wheat bread every morning and a glass of unsweetened almondmilk at night . i don ’ t drink any soda or eat any dessert . but i daily feel the need to brush and floss , and i really can ’ t figure out why , given that i eat zero sugar , apart from the tiny amount they add to the slice of bread i eat . could you help me understand this issue a little better ? is there something i ’ m doing wrong ? jane , he was making the comparison using something we all know – eating sweets and its predictable consequence : cavitiessimilarly , eating sad has a consequence : chdplease continue to brush and floss.cavities are not caused by sugar , they are caused by bacteria and bacteria feeds on sugar whether it is from candy or bread or potatoes , etc . get rid of the bacteria and keep it gone and you will have no cavities.hi dr. greger , your videos are great and have helped me a lot ! i have some questions about cardiovascular diseases ; i ’ ve hear some claims that high blood pressure might be a bigger issue than cholesterol , can that be true ? how does diet influence high blood pressure , other than salt ? yeah , ummm … cholesterol in your arteries _ creates _ high blood pressure . the one causes the other . don ’ t want high blood pressure ? don ’ t eat animal products … because they create the plaques that build up on your artery walls . too much plaque … smaller diameter for blood to flow through … bernoulli ’ s principle of fluid mechanics … ah , but i get ahead of myself.according to dr colin campbell , cholesterol is merely a marker for animal product consumption ( .94 correlation ) and is not the cause of heart disease . dr campbell believes its actually the animal foods which select for gut bacteria which produce tma , which is then oxidized and eventually damages arterial endothelium . it may be possible to eat substantial amounts of saturated fat , as in coconut oil , and not develop dyslipidemia.as always , i enjoy the encouragement you send with your posts and videos . thank you ! great post dr greger.a friend of mine in his early “ 70 ” was diagnosed by his cardiologist years back with plaque build up in his arteries and was told that he needed surgery to correct this plaque problem.he decided to go to his naturopathic physician for a second opinion and was told by him to take serrapeptase 40,000 units twice daily for 2 months and to then have another ultra sound to see if plaque was gone and after the ultra sound the plaque had dissolved and there was no blockage any more.i ’ ve been taking serrapeptase ever since hearing of this , dr han a. nieper an internist from hannover germany studied the effects of serrapeptase on plaque accumalations in the arteries.my question to you dr.greger is if you ’ ve ever heard of this enzyme serrapeptase and that it desolves plaque in the arteries ? thanks for all your helpful information . dennisdid the np recommend a wfpb diet ? copied from wikipedia . confused on “ little meat ” in diet . most tribes in uganda have their own speciality dish or delicacy . many dishes include various vegetables , potatoes , yams , bananas and other tropical fruits . chicken , fish ( usually fresh , but there is also a dried variety , reconstituted for stewing ) , [ 1 ] beef , goat [ 1 ] and mutton are all commonly eaten , although among the rural poor , meats are consumed less than in other areas . nyama is the swahili word for “ meat ” . [ 2 ] in the article in 50 ’ s it also states : ” meat and fish were eaten in small amounts ” .so you can eat some meat and not have adverse effects on heart health apparently.http : / / ije.oxfordjournals.org / content / 41 / 5 / 1225.longor more likely , you can eat very small amounts of wild meat ( much lower fat and toxin content ) and likely have less negative effects than if you eat more . but of course its usually the case that eating far less of something very unhealthy has less negative impacts . calling that “ healthy ” is a big stretch.could be . though they have cattle , goats , sheep etc , and the meat if probably more fresh.the same stuff happened in crete , and japan ( okinawa ) . you can eat some animalstuff without having negative effects on heart health and have some positive effects of omega-3 + b12 also.i think the message from this post is “ monitor your cholesterol and keep it low to avoid heart disease . ” other vid ’ s here explain the science showing that all animal products are bad for you . if / when people choose to indulge in meat it should be considered a calculated risk , not good nutrition . there are no loopholes in science … unless you are a quantum mechanic : ) nice piece dr. greger , but i was confused by a couple of things . in a video you made a while ago you did an excellent job of tracking down why vegetarians and vegans had no better health outcomes ( including heart disease as i recall ) than carnivores at one point . also as i recall you actually discussed the mechanisms behind atherosclerosis and argued that vegans needed to supplement their diets with omega 3 fatty acids ( if they weren ’ t getting any or enough ) and b12 ( which is virtually impossible to get in a specifically unfortified diet ) . so how did the ugandans avoid heart disease on a strictly plant based diet ? ( btw i ’ m a vegan happily taking my b12 ! ) no it states : “ meat and fish were eaten in small amounts ” . http : / / ije.oxfordjournals.org / content / 41 / 5 / 1225.longalso in uganda they eat insects . that will take care of some b12i saw documentary that meat is brain food especially fish.mankind evolve from monkeys when their diet shfited to meat.so there may be some downside to vegetarian diet related to dementia.concern : i understand your concern . : - ) but i would suggest that the documentary you saw is probably not all that accurate in several respects . for example , my understanding is that your brain “ eats ” glucose – not anything found in meat . also , the concept that eating meat is what helped our ancestors to evolve into humans is by no means a scientific consensus . and there is * plenty * of evidence that this is simply not true . here ’ s one source that i find extremely compelling : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / natural.htmlthe link between fish and brain health is highly suspect . here is info on one study : “ … in a new review looking at omega-3 supplementation for brain health , researchers found no link between omega-3 supplements and the prevention or improvement of dementia . ” bosch j , gerstein hc , diaz r , et al. n – 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with dysglycemia . n engl j med . published online june 11 , 2012.lastly , i ’ ll point out that dr. barnard spent a lot of time reviewing all of the research on the topic of brain health vs dementia and alzheimers . he wrote a book called , “ power foods for the brain , an effective 3 step plan to protect your mind and strengthen your memory ” and after all that research , dr. barnard does not recommend that people eat * any * meat ( or dairy or eggs ) .hope that helps with your concerns.vegetarian diet related to dementiai worked in nursing homes from 1970 to 2005 . all the dementia patients were meat eaters . the few people i know that developed dementia and are vegetarians are lacto-ovo and ate plenty of sugar , fat , cheese and other junk food . they didn ’ t know a what healthy diet was . they just didn ’ t eat meat.you ’ ll never know just how timely your comment was in this house … so helpful to hear from someone with field experience . thank youas we were gathering around the table this morning for our daily treatment team meeting a sweet 40 year old rn mentioned that she had just run a half marathon . i congratulated her and proceeded to tell her about the cherry juice exercise recovery study previously featured by dr. greger . she was very interested and i showed her the video . at that point the psychologist , also a runner , piped in , “ yeh , but i can ’ t stand the taste of cherries . ” what he can stand is the taste of diet pepsi , which he guzzles throughout the day almost as often as i do green tea . for the majority of people i know , whether they be colleagues , co-workers , or patients , taste is the overriding factor in what people eat . hence the coronary vs. cavity reference in today ’ s blog.dr. greger , of all the fine videos and articles you have created , i think that your finest has been publishing the notion that heart disease is a personal choice … that a person can choose whether or not to develop it . also that it can be reversed if a person already has it . given that the heart and stroke statistics published by the american heart association says that about 70 percent of all people ages 60-79 have heart disease , and about 85 % of all people age 80 + have it , it is stunning to know that so many of us are ill by the time we reach retirement . absolutely stunning . we can only hope that your videos and articles reach more people so that they can learn how to manage their health through diet while they still have a chance ! cholesterol in the blood is mostly manufactured by the body , not from dietery intake . the genetic link is the strongest.but the kind that gets stuck to your artery walls and forms plaque is from ? let me help you out – animal products.let me help you out . it has little to do with animal products ( though i agree we should minimize them ) . it has all to due with your genetic inheritance – and the body ’ s own propensity to make cholesterol . diet does not significantly reduce bad cholesterol in many people . the crucial factor is genes . recent study of 500 men who lived to between 95-110 years old . 60 % were smokers ; half were overweight . genes again.the study you cite looked at a group of ashkenazi jews . this population is noted for a number of unique genetic characteristics , but to use this miniscule group of outliers to draw any conclusions regarding the effects of diet is specious.the genetic makeup of the human is the critical factor here – not diet . some people simply produce too much cholesterol , whether they eat steak or seaweed . for years i have eaten an almost vegetarian diet , often subsisting on beans and vegetables and whole grains – cannot lower my cholesterol to a disease-reversal level — can ’ t even come close ( ! ) without horrid statin drugs that shut down liver production of chol . please now , don ’ t tell me i don ’ t know me … .you can lower you ldl . read preventing and reversing heart disease by dr esselstyn and follow the diet exactly . moderation kills . watch his videos on youtube . he reversed the heart diseae in very heart sick people . it works ! what have you got to lose and everything to gain.thanks for the comment – but i ’ ve already tried it , and ornish . it can work – for some people , but many people simply cannot get low ldl from diet alone.i also have genetically high cholesterol ( 300-400 range ) and yes , even following a very strict , healthy plant-based diet won ’ t get my ldl and total chol to the levels that most docs are happy with . however , when i looked at all my cholesterol readings from over the last 20 odd years i found that when i follow the fok / ornish / essylstyn diet i was able to lower my levels of ldl and total chol and improve hdl and trigs . for the last 5-6 years i went on statins and allowed my diet to slip back to sad ( vegetarian style ) . now i ’ m off statins for good ( side effects are awful ) and am transitioning back to a clean plant-based diet . i ’ ve never had heart disease ( my father died of complications of it ) and am a healthy weight , nonsmoker , female . hoping to convince my doc that statins aren ’ t for me and to give plant-based eating another go . i think for some of us , even with an awesome diet , the numbers won ’ t get to where most docs want them , but i ’ m mostly convinced that it doesn ’ t matter if one sticks to clean eating.thanks sookiebird , for your comment . i stay on a mostly plant diet , but cannot take essylstyn completely . that would mean no oils at all , no tree nuts , yogurts , etc . just too hard for me . i too have had a terrible time with statins . i am able to lower my bad chol. with diet , but never really get under about 110 ldl . i need to get down to about 70 . my focus now is more exercise ; that should also boost hdl.thanks barneygoogle for raising some good points . for people like us who have hereditary high cholesterol it ’ s hard to know what it all means . hopefully there will be more studies to see if lifestyle choices will give us better outcomes despite the crazy high cholesterol numbers . i guess i see it as an odds game where the cleaner my diet is , the better odds that it will have a good effect . i also have trouble adjusting to a no oil diet , so i try to do a very low oil diet . i consume nuts and seeds in moderation as well.there is a shift towards the importance of particle size as well.i have read that would like to know more about it.sookiebird and gar : check out this nutritionfacts video about particle size : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-cholesterol-size-matter / wow , always have to follow the money , thanks for the link ! eliminating the oils is one of the keys . dr esselstyn says moderation kills . this is why he had such a hard time with his heart sick patients . he had to meet with them every week to a see what was keeping their cholesterol high but he eventually got it down . one of his patient ’ s cholesterol was high because he was putting oils on his salads . cutting out oils is not that difficult . very few people have the genetic makeup that prevents it if they follow the dr e ’ s diet exactly . it ’ s not worth the heart problems down the road . don ’ t give up . this has been proven to work . i wish you all the best in your health.dr. esselstyn actually once called me on the telephone after i left an email on his site ! he is a very dedicated man . i try to follow his diet , but just can ’ t make it 100 per cent . however , i use almost no oils , sometimes a small spray of extra virgin olive oil . he said oils wreck the endolithium , the inner lining of the arteries.you are on the right track . my approach was to follow it exactly to see if i could get there and i did . i will do “ anything ” to avoid heart problems and other diseases as i have experienced them and they are much more extreme than following the diet . good health to you and others.barneygoogle … .. of course any degree to which you can adhere to a low fat vegan diet is better than no change . if you have genetics predisposing you to heart disease or high ldl , this is all the more reason to become 100 % compliant ! ! once again , as with most people the addictive nature of oils becomes our undoing . a few nuts and little oil here and there is not an ideal diet for those with heart disease or potential disease . what is more important to you barney ? feeding the addictive taste of fats and sugars — -or staying alive ? if you were critical , you betcha you ’ d cut those those oils and nuts out fast . do you really want to get to that point ? ( read mcdougall and esselstyn ) . a brief story about me . i am 60 with a kidney transplant . ordinarily kidney patients are highly lipidemic , a good majority of which die from stroke and chd . anti rejection drugs raise lipids quite high . because i have high risks for cv disease , i follow a strict low fat vegan diet . my lipid numbers are better than most ordinary people in the us . cholesterol 141 , triglycerides 115 , ldl 65 , and i am taking highly cardiovascular damaging drugs . now if a very low fat vegan diet can easily help someone like me , think how well it can work for those not taking anti-rejection drugs with high ldl numbers or those with heart disease . i recently had an angiogram . it is a long story why — but the result was no plaques no blockages . the results of a nuclear scan was false positive ! ! ! i can can tell that these results are extremely unusual for transplant patients . while you are doing well barney , please correct your diet to a true low fat diet before you experience any heart related events . ( as you know heart disease is the number one killer in the entire world ! ! ! you might be one of those people . incidentally , ldl cholesterol according to my cardiologist is the number you should be watching to keep heart disease in check . although i do think that dr j mcdougall has stated that total cholesterol is the most important number and that hdl contributes little to the overall disease risk . ( hdl lowers as cholesterol levels decrease ) . thanks for letting me tell my story.incidentally , i have had kidney disease since i was 8 and now i am 60 . i was vegetarian in the 80 ’ s , vegan with non dairy fats in the 90 ’ s , and low fat vegan in the 2000 ’ s . i ’ m quite certain that doctors do not see this kind of longevity with kidney disease . i have read that many kidney patients die of heart attacks before they even get to dialysis.norman : wow ! that ’ s really awesome . thanks for sharing ! thanks ! sookiebird : good for you ! it ’ s really not as hard as most people fear . and since you have done it before , you know what the learning curve is like . just know that there are so many good and easy recipes out there now that fall into the “ clean eating ” category . it gets easier to do every year.it sounds like you already know how to avoid foods that raise cholesterol . i will suggest that you also search this site for foods that have been specifically shown to lower cholesterol . that way you can tweak your diet with the latest information that is specific to your situation.good luck ! thanks thea . i think adjusting to no oil takes a shift in taste / palate . i also live with 3 other people ( hubs and two kids ) who have different food preferences and that can make it tempting to splurge on the not so good foods . so my goal is to focus on the gift of wfpb eating and what it does for my body and not on deprivation : ) .familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the categories that you are referencing , and my professors would state that there is nothing you can do except medications for lowering the cholesterol levels . this distinction between a small percentage and the mass majority needs to be stated . ( i wish i could state and site the prevalence rates , but it would take some reviewing my reference works ) possibly because they do not have the fortitude and determination to stick to this diet which requires significant lifestyle adjustment.agreed , psych md ! please stop it with the snarky comments . when you set up a rule ( or diet ) that 98 % of the people can ’ t realistically meet – then castigate them for not meeting it – you are being the fool.sorry if i have been offensive , barneygoogle , please forgive me . my point is only that in order to achieve the results , it takes an inordinate ( and rare ) amount of drive and will-power ( and time ) . i do agree with you that 98 % of us do not currently have the kind of dedication or force of will to do the diet to the degree that it must be done in order to achieve the reversal of heart disease – myself included . i only want to make it clear to other readers that the science is not in question – the fact that the diet works to prevent and reverse heart disease is certainly proven . the only thing in question is whether people are willing ( or able ) to fight the battle it takes to follow the diet ( as written ) . again , i apologize for making you ( or others ) feel antagonized . it was not my intent.barney , i do not see any snarky comments . when people are faced with death , you betcha they change their diets . ( for those without serious health problems , such as teenagers , motivation is usually lacking ) . i can tell you with great confidence , once you have eaten an esselstyn or mcdougall diet for a couple of months or sooner you will love it . you won ’ t believe how you could have eaten all that crappy sad food ! ! promise ! … ( for anyone living their golden years , atherosclerosis is usually present ) . nothing like present , eh ? barneygoogle , if you examine the book engine 2 diet by rip esselstyn , it doesn ’ t appear that “ cholesterol in the blood is mostly manufactured by the body , not from dietary intake . ” subjects eating the engine 2 diet for 28 days had substantial decreases in their cholesterol values . there is certainly a genetic link for the small percentage of people who have familial hypercholesterolemia.just to make it clear to everyone reading barneygoogle ’ s comments , later on , he mentions that he wasn ’ t really able to actually follow the heart disease prevention diet ( too restrictive for his tastes ) . as for me , switching from lacto-ovo-veg to vegan ( not low oil ) dropped 100 pts off my cholesterol . but , i am not a member of the very small minority of people who have a genetic ( as opposed to diet based ) propensity for high cholesterol.please let me be clear . my goal was ldl under 70 . that ’ s reversal , not just good health level at 100 . i could not totally follow esselstyn for very long , but i do follow it about 90 % – adding avery little fish , chicken ( 4 oz every other day ) , yogurt and nuts . his diet is just not realistic for long term use by the vast majority of people . much too hard , too time consuming , not gratifying , too tough for me . i followed ornish ; didn ’ t work . followed medit . , and it didn ’ t work , but my numbers were almost as good as on esselstyn . so now i combine key points of medit and esselstyn . its realistic for me , with adding a small statin dosage . i now focus more on controlled exercise . that helps too.barneygoogle , at first it seemed you were saying earlier that the prevention / reversal diet of esselstyn does not work . as in , many people who are on it do not get benefit from it . but now i understand that you were saying it does not work for you , because you do not chose to employ it ( since it is “ too hard ” ) . i absolutely agree . that diet is a major lifestyle change . you have to have serious motivation and drive ( and time ) in order to accomplish it . but the reason it does not work for you is not : 1. because “ cholesterol in the blood is mostly manufactured by the body , not from dietery intake ” 2. or because “ the genetic link is the strongest . ” 3. or because “ diet does not significantly reduce bad cholesterol in many people ” 4. or because you lack the genetic buffering capacity that affects longevity found in a very small , tightly cohesive genetic population ( ashkenazi jewish study mentioned ) .it did not work for you , barneygoogle , because you did not follow it . following esselstyn is like being pregnant . you follow it all the way , or you are not on the diet . there is no 90 % pregnant , and there is no 90 % esselstyn . no judgement against you here – i , myself , have realized that esselstyn ’ s diet would be the best for our hearts , but worry that i would not be able to sustain that eating pattern for any length of time , and so have not switched us from whole food ( + oil ) vegan.but since this is a science based website , i think it is important that we be clear that this diet has been proven to work for heart disease , and we should not allow it to appear as if we are refuting the validity of the well-documented study ( ies ) on this subject.all that aside , i am sorry that you have to be on a pill that makes you miserable , and i hope you can find a way to be rid of it soon . best of luck.whoa. please stop making specific comments about me ? you don ’ t know me , or my life . it is people like you – who are well-meaning – okay , but cocksure about everything , who can do a lot of harm . slow down . a plant based diet is good for health . i live close to it . i believe in it . eating a plant based diet does not magically reverse heart disease . i tried it . no success . not realistic for most people , anyway . i do not have hyperchol – either . plant based diets may help reverse heart disease in a significant number of people — but that is not the same thing as offering a cure / reversal . doctors trumpet their successes – and ignore their failures . we still do not know what diet is best for each individual , based on health , genes , etc . why would anyone think one diet , one med , one lifestyle , is best for everyone ? then there are the issues of heart meds , exercise , stress , happiness – many factors go into reversing heart disease . i am writing a book on my own long battle . don ’ t write the final chapter for me yet . my mind remains open to many possibilities . you should , too.you are the one making specific statements . it didn ’ t , work for you because you didn ’ t follow it . everthing else you have said is your opinion ldr esselstyn has proven that it works in two different trials with real heart sicks . your words can affect others who need help . be cai ask anyone to compare what i have said , to your comments , and then judge . in fact , i did try the plant diet for a year , with no improvements . to me , it is not realistic to eat plants ( and little else ) for a lifetime . i cannot spend 4-to-5 hours a day shopping for and preparing fresh foods in fancy recipes for every meal . maddening . never again eat in a restaurant ? unrealistic . never eat with family , unrealistic — i told that to esselstyn . its foolish and self-defeating to lash out at people who cannot do unreasonably difficult things – do you get that ? my penn heart center ( one of the best in the world ) doctor agrees with me.yes , i do eat whole foods whenever possible , tons of vegs and salads , avoid oils ( a la esselstyn ) , and exercise daily . i believe exercise for me , is as important as diet . we ’ re all different . there is no one cure . i have read everything i can on the subject from gary taubes , to weston price , weil , null , fuhrman , to esselstyn and ornish . i have talked to many fine heart doctors . everybody cherry-picks their data . why ? there ’ s money and prestige in it . now , i agree , esselstyn seems logical and honorable , but his studies are small . much of what he says in his book is anecdotal . like i have said — anybody here reversing heart disease ? hummm ? well , how did you do it ? i will listen . you probably ain ’ t doin ’ it eatin ’ seaweed , or the bag it came in.barneygoogle a wfpb diet actually isn ’ t that difficult . it doesn ’ t require a chef . it is just different from what you are used to so it requires some adjustment . so for 1 year you ate wfpb-no animal and added oils , nuts , avocado etc and your ldl did not get below 70 ? i am asking this because you said you followed it but then you said you eat chicken . i am just a bit confused.another factor is your weight . are you lean ? it ’ s great you have added exercise . that should help a bit too.a plant-based diet is very difficult for a meat eater . big transition . then , there ’ s the logistics : go to a super market – the kale , bok choy , collards , broccoli , all wilted or yellow as they sit there for – how long ? what nutrition in weeks old greens ? cardboard tomatoes ? what good are greens in cans ? most froz greens are low quality stuff , or processed . you need a whole foods store near you , or live on a farm to get fresh greens . and if you live in the northern climes , winter-time whole foods are always an issue . how do you eat at nephew ’ s birthday party ? thanksgiving dinner with family ? christmas ? the night out with friends at the diner ? very hard to live the diet 100 % i get to about 90 % , which i think is really good . the
72	how seafood can impact brain development in my video fish intake associated with brain shrinkage , i discussed evidence suggesting that mercury exposure through fish intake during pregnancy may decrease the size of the newborn ’ s brain . however , just because fish-eating mothers may give birth to children with smaller brains doesn ’ t necessarily mean their children will grow up with neurological defects . in the video , mercury vs. omega-3s for brain development , you can see real-time functional mri scans of teens whose moms ate a lot of seafood when pregnant . because these kinds of scans can measure brain activity , as opposed to just brain size , we can more accurately determine if exposure to mercury and pcbs affected these kids . you can see an mri of what a normal brain looks like when you flash a light in someone ’ s eyes , but the mri is significantly different for the mercury and pcb exposed brains , suggesting toxicant related damage to the visual centers in brain . ( for more on the effect of mercury on teens , see nerves of mercury ) . fish consumption may also increase the risk of our children being born with epilepsy . so does maternal fish consumption have an effect on how smart our kids turn out ? the dha in fish — a long chain omega 3 fatty acid — is good for brain development , but mercury is bad for brain development . so a group of researchers looked at 33 different fish species to see what the net effect of these compounds would have on children ’ s iq . for most fish species , they found that “ the adverse effect of mercury on the iq scores of children exceeded the beneficial effects of dha . ” in fact , so much brainpower may be lost from fish consumption that the united states may actually lose $ 5 billion in economic productivity every year . for example , if pregnant women ate tuna every day , the dha would add a few iq points . but the mercury in that very same tuna would cause so much brain damage that the overall effect of eating tuna while pregnant would be negative , wiping out an average of eight iq points . the only two fish that were more brain-damaging than tuna were pike and swordfish . at the other end of the spectrum , the brain boosting effect of dha may trump the brain damaging effects of mercury in salmon by a little less than one iq point . unfortunately , iq only takes into consideration the cognitive damage caused by mercury , not the adverse effects on motor function and attention and behavior deficits . we think that attention span may be particularly vulnerable to developmental mercury exposure , probably due to damage to the frontal lobes of the brain . and the iq study didn ’ t take into account the relatively high levels of pcbs in salmon and the accompanying concerns about cancer risk . sustainability concerns are another wrinkle , as farm-raised salmon are considered a “ fish to avoid . ” while king mackerel is considered a best choice for sustainability , the mercury levels are so high as to warrant avoiding consumption — exceeding both the fda and epa action levels for mercury contamination . but why risk any loss in intelligence at all when pregnant women can get all the dha they want from microalgae supplements without any of the contaminants ? we can then get the brain boost without the brain damage . more on pcbs in : are you labeling all fish as having a greater negative ratio of mercury to dha , or are there sources of fish and shellfish where the dha positive effect is far higher than the negative mercury effect ( level ) ? what about some species of wild caught shrimp , virtually void of mercury , as well as cold water mussels and clams , all showing very little if any mercury at times ? and what about the japanese fish eaters ? there are lots of them.to my knowledge not all fish and shellfish contain pcb ’ s and mercury at levels that negate the positive dha benefits , as well as natural b12 , but please someone correct me if i am wrong . we deserve clarity here , and we need it ! ! ! ! … … .i want to be plant-based and vegan as much as possible , but i also would like to know the big picture for this issue , and not just assume that there are not fish and shellfish out there that can be of benefit for people who struggle with digestion issues / nutrient depletion , absorption / amino acid absorption on a vegan diet … … .. as well as being able to handle b12 supplements without adverse effects.what about sardines ? dr. greger , you mention microalgae supplements as a good alternative . what about flax seed ? from my understanding , if you don ’ t get dha sources from animal products , your body converts ala ( the main source of omega 3 in flaxseed ) to dha more efficiently.according to an article in nutrition reviews ( vol . 66 , pp. 326-332 ) , between eight and 20 per cent of ala is converted to epa in humans , and between 0.5 and nine percent of ala is converted to dha . in addition , the gender plays an important role with women of reproductive age reportedly converting ala to epa at a 2.5-fold greater rate than healthy men.at 0.5-9 % , you ’ d have to consume a lot of ala to reach your daily dose.i thought gregor had previously warned against algae supplements in the video on spirulina … . i ’ m confused … johnb : here ’ s my understanding : there are different types of algea . spirulina is a type that is associated with becoming contaminated and having problems . however , the “ microalgea ” dha pills you can buy are made from special algea that is grown in highly controlled sterile environments . no worries ( all else being equal ) about contamination.make sense ?

73	why pregnant women should avoid tuna all fish contain small amounts of methylmercury , the most toxic form of mercury , and “ fish consumption represents the main source of methylmercury exposure . ” in my videos nerves of mercury and fish fog , i discuss how mercury exposure through fish consumption , even within the government ’ s safety limits , can have adverse neurological and behavioral effects on child development . severe exposure can cause overt structural brain abnormalities like microcephaly , a shrunken brain disorder . but we didn ’ t know whether low exposure could also affect brain size until recently . autopsy studies suggest mercury preferentially affects the developing cerebellum , so researchers used ultrasound to measure cerebellum size in newborns of mothers who had high body levels of mercury . let ’ s put those levels into practical terms . in the video , fish intake associated with brain shrinkage , you can see the results of a study measuring mercury concentration in human hair . just one can of tuna a week raises human hair mercury concentration to levels nearly three times as high as the “ high ” group in the ultrasound study . so the bodies of the women suffering high mercury contamination were considered heavily contaminated , but even just a little canned tuna once in a while could bump our levels even higher . so the high really wasn ’ t that high . but what did they find ? the researchers demonstrated that babies born to mothers with higher hair mercury levels had cerebellums up to 14 % shorter than those born to mothers with lower hair mercury levels . they conclude that prenatal exposure to what may be considered low-levels of methylmercury does indeed influence fetal brain development as evidenced “ by decreased size of a newborn ’ s brain . ” but what about the long chain omega-3 dha in fish — isn ’ t that necessary for healthy brain development ? that ’ s the topic of my video mercury vs. omega-3s for brain development . for more on canned tuna in particular , check out : “ cerebellums up to 14 % shorter ” “ up to ” is a lousy way to summarize a distribution . it ’ s common in advertising , but not consistent with a scientific frame of mind . ( disclaimer : i am a subscriber to this site and i don ’ t eat fish . ) agreed with the “ up to 14 % ” comment.and what about the selenium intake … .i ’ ve read selenium prevents the detrimental effects of the mercury . is there truth in this theory ? dr. greger , or any other dr. ’ s or knowledgeable folks here … .. how about transdermal iodine ? safe ? effective ? prudent ? both vegans and non-vegans claim it is an awesome source of iodine but does it work , and is there reason for concern ? having hard time tracking down literature on this , in regards to “ science ” . thanks.what about trout ? does trout pose a risk to pregnant women ? all fish contain methylmercury , none of which is good for pregnant women , fetuses , or anyone else . fish also contain other accumulated toxins , cholesterol , saturated fat , parasites , etc.why needlessly subject yourself or your children to health hazards ? all of the nutrients derived from fish -and other animal products- can be obtained more healthfully , humanely and environmentally responsibly from plant sources . do the responsible thing : be vegan , for everyone ’ s sake.my son and his wife went trout fishing . i ’ m wondering how much mercury is in trout because she ’ s pregnant . i am a vegan but they are not . spare me the lecture.but what about this study ? ? the scds has shown that seychellois children have a normal range of development when compared to children in developed countries . so far , we have not found clear evidence of abnormal or delayed development in children as a result of their mother ’ s consumption of fish during pregnancy.the seychelles child development study ( scds ) is a research project involving the ministries of health and education in seychelles , the university of ulster in northern ireland , and the university of rochester in the united states . the study began in the mid-1980s with two main objectives : to study child development in the republic of seychellesto study factors , such as diet , that may modulate associations between mercury exposure and child developmentto study effects of prenatal and postnatal mercury exposureto study exposure to organic and inorganic mercuryto study factors that modulate associations between mercury exposure and child developmentto study the relation between mercury exposure and disabilities such as autismhttp : / / www.urmc.rochester.edu / pediatrics / research / seychelles-child-development-study.aspxthis is giving me a scare . my husband and i are planning to have our first baby . as i have been reading posts and articles about the path to pregnancy , but it seems difficult to cope with . for instance http : / / bit.ly / 1s6wudy , i am thinking how difficult it would be to go through the 9 months . other than chicken , fish is not just my father ’ s , but my favorite as well . are there any alternative source for omega 3 other than the food supplement such as fish oil i am taking ? flax seed and walnuts are good omega 3 sources.call me an elephant , but i just love nuts . didn ’ t realize walnuts are good sources for omega 3 too . thanks.andrea : if you are ok with taking pills , then how about using an algea based dha ( omega 3 ) pill ? the vegan omega 3 pills are completely safe . there are several companies out there now that sell fish-free omega 3 . i ’ ve even seen one in my local health food store . here is an on-line example ( i ’ m not promoting any particular brand . just giving you an idea ) : http : / / www.devanutrition.com / vegan _ dha _ softgels.htmlalso , i thought you might be interested in the following page which does a good job of explaining * safe * nutrition options for pregnant women , infants , on up through teens. http : / / www.vrg.org / family / kidsindex.htmhi thea , thanks for sharing me this . i am enlightened . i know i can ’ t win my friends with salad , but i don ’ t mind . perhaps , people will know what a wonderful life is with all these veggies . my husband is trying to cooperate , he plans to have an all veggie week this week.andrea : good luck ! eating healthy can be a learning curve , but when you get over it , you will look back and think that it ’ s really not all that hard.i did want to point out one little thing : you mentioned “ veggies ” twice . i just want to make sure that is your short-hand for “ whole plant foods ” . the point is : you don ’ t have to * just * eat vegetables / salad . if you tried that , i imagine you would be hungry a lot . and you might miss out on some important nutrition . so , don ’ t forget all of the other foods that are so good ( and filling ) to have in your diet : whole intact grains ( barley , rice , quinoa , millet , farro , wheat berries , steel cut oats , etc ) , legumes ( all those beans and pea varieties ) , fruit ( especially berries ) , and nuts and seeds ( in moderation = 1-2 ounces a day ) .if you are new to this , i recommend some good cookbooks that will give you some good ideas and are delicious ! a new one i just got attached to is vegan casseroles . and some old favorites ( all available on amazon ) are : everyday happy herbivore , let them eat vegan , and vegan on the cheap . some friends of mine are swearing by the new book , thug kitchen ( and you can get a lot of their recipes for free on-line . ) but the book has too much swearing for me to get myself.hope that helps . i ’ m keeping my fingers crossed for both you and your husband ! hi thea ! i have to say thank you from the bottom of my heart . it ’ s been almost a month now that we ’ re having brown rice and considering oat meal and peanut butter for breakfast . perhaps , i wouldn ’ t notice the change , but my friends and my husband did . the whole vegetable thing for lunch and dinner is really helping . as far as i know i need to keep a healthy body before we are having our first baby . ( that rhymes , eh ? ) and that means , i have to lose these extra pounds . i hope next year would be a good year for us. brain health , children , cognition , fish , heavy metals , infants , mental health , mercury , pregnancy , safety limits , seafood , tuna , women 's health - -
74	how fatty foods may affect our love life the food industry , like the tobacco companies and other drug lords , has been able to come up with products that tap into the same dopamine reward system that keeps people smoking cigarettes , using marijuana , and eating candy bars ( see are sugary foods addictive ? ) . new research , highlighted in my video are fatty foods addictive ? suggests that fat may have similar effects on the brain . if people are fed yogurt packed with butter fat , within 30 minutes they exhibit the same brain activity as those who just drank sugar water . people who regularly eat ice cream ( sugar and fat ) have a deadened dopamine response in their brains in response to drinking a milkshake . it ’ s similar to when drug abusers have to use more and more to get the same high . frequent ice cream consumption “ is related to a reduction in reward-region ( pleasure center ) responsivity in humans , paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addiction . ” once we ’ ve so dulled our dopamine response , we may subsequently overeat in an effort to achieve the degree of satisfaction experienced previously , contributing to unhealthy weight gain . what do fatty and sugary foods have in common ? they are energy-dense . it may be less about the number of calories than their concentration . consumption of a calorie-dilute diet doesn ’ t lead to deadened dopamine responsivity , but a calorie-dense diet with the same number of calories does . it ’ s like the difference between cocaine and crack : same stuff chemically , but by smoking crack cocaine we can deliver a higher dose quicker to our brain . as an aside , i found it interesting that the control drink in these milkshake studies wasn ’ t just water . they can ’ t use water because our brain actually tastes water on the tongue ( who knew ! ) . so instead the researchers had people drink a solution “ designed to mimic the natural taste of saliva . ” ew ! anyway , with this new understanding of the neural correlates of food addiction , there have been calls to include obesity as an official mental disorder . after all , both obesity and addiction share the inability to restrain behavior in spite of an awareness of detrimental health consequences , one of the defining criteria of substance abuse . we keep putting crap in our bodies despite the knowledge that we have a problem that is likely caused by the crap , yet we can ’ t stop ( a phenomena called the “ pleasure trap ” ) . redefining obesity as an addiction , a psychiatric disease , would be a boon to the drug companies that are already working on a whole bunch of drugs to muck with our brain chemistry . for example , subjects given an opiate blocker ( like what ’ s done for people with heroin overdoses to block the effects of the drug ) eat significantly less cheese — it just doesn ’ t do as much for them anymore when their opiate receptors are blocked . rather than taking drugs , though , we can prevent the deadening of our pleasure center in the first place by sticking to foods that are naturally calorically dilute , like whole plant foods . this can help bring back our dopamine sensitivity such that we can again derive the same pleasure from the simplest of foods ( see changing our taste buds ) . and this is not just for people who are obese . when we regularly eat calorie dense animal and junk foods like ice cream , we can blunt our pleasure so that we may overeat to compensate . when our brain down-regulates dopamine receptors to deal with all these jolts of fat and sugar , we may experience less enjoyment from other activities as well . that ’ s why cocaine addicts may have an impaired neurological capacity to enjoy sex , and why smokers have an impaired ability to respond to positive stimuli . since these all involve the same dopamine pathways , what we put into our body — what we eat — can affect how we experience all of life ’ s pleasures . so to live life to the fullest , what should we do ? the food industry , according to some addiction specialists , “ should be given incentives to develop low calorie foods that are more attractive , palatable and affordable so that people can adhere to diet programs for a long time . ” no need ! mother nature beat them to it – that ’ s what the produce aisle is for . by starting to eat healthfully , we can actually change how things taste . healthiest means whole plant foods , which tend to be naturally dilute given their water and fiber content . not only is fiber also calorie-free , but one might think of it as having “ negative ” calories , given the fermentation of fiber in our bowel into anti-obesity compounds ( as well as anti-inflammatory , anti-cancer compounds ) . for this reason , those eating plant-based diets eat hundreds of fewer calories without even trying . ( see my video nutrient-dense approach to weight management ) . this is the theory on “ massive ingestion ” of raw fruits such as dates and bananas , in that their such intense pleasurable effect ( high-sugar ) can take over the dopamine response . one can become less motivated . basically , satisfied by the fruit , missing out on living . any thoughts on this ? sort of like being drunk on fruit.natural sugar doesn ’ t have the same effect on the body as manufactured sugar.dr. g , i thought that marijuana activated cannabinoid receptors instead of the dopamine reward system . ( of course , now that i think about it , i ’ m sure there ’ s no reason it couldn ’ t activate both . ) in either case , does marijuana ’ s activation of the dopamine reward system make marijuana harmful ? i ’ m especially curious about this given the rise of medical marijuana and , frankly , the rise of legalized recreational marijuana . we all know that pretty much all smoke is carcinogenic , but is marijuana itself harmful , say if it ’ s infused into olive oil ? i ’ ve heard that moderate use ( 1-2 times a month ) is actually beneficial , especially to one ’ s psychology , and i ’ d really like to hear your thoughts on that.did they do a study about consuming fat alone ? or were they all sugar + fat ? seems to me it may be the sugar not the fat.nope. not sugar alone . as i addressed in dr. greger ’ s previous blog post , no one binges on spoonfuls of pure white cane sugar.disqus is not playing well with my cellphone right now , so i can ’ t copy and paste a link to my post ( try my disqus profile ) … also … . try googling the title , “ cheesecake-eating rats and the question of food addiction “ .then the title of this article is misleading . that ’ s like smoking crack and eating an apple at the same time and then blaming the apple for the addiction . why not study eating fat alone and see what happens ? what about sodas ? they ’ re nothing but sugar and water and people certainly binge on them.soda is not plain sugar and water . there ‘ s more going on there , what with flavorings and co2 and who knows what else . it ’ s an experience beyond sugar water.all you need to know is a can of coke contains close to 40 grams of sugar . find a study where fat was consumed with no sugar and no simple carbs.here ya go.why are you posting a pic of yourself ? not me . that ’ s the unbalanced author of keto clarity , who promotes a very low carb , very high fat diet.what does this photo have to do with you not being able to find a study of fat consumption without sugar or simple carbs ? and what about the misleading title in this post ? misread your comment . thought you wanted an example of excessive fat consumption without sugar and simple carbs and jimmy came to mind immediately.why do you need to fat shame jimmy ? at least he has the courage to leave it all out there … http : / / livinlavidalowcarb.com / blog / beforeandafteranyone who writes books promoting damaging nutritional falsehoods , and lies about his own health and weight cycling , lies whicht contradict his own public blog posts deserves to be called out on that . it ’ s not fat shaming.this post is not about him . you brought him into this discussion . you keep avoiding answering why the title of this post misleading . and ? i did not say the title of this post is misleading . that ’ s what you said . answer your own doggone question . i ’ ve got a good night ’ s sleep to get . over and out . “ answer your own doggone question . ” lol i must ’ ve hit a nerve . good night . i hope you toss and turn all night dreaming up an answer to my question.dear macsmiley , i think it was very kind of you to try and help someone else with their questions ! and don ’ t forget , there ’ s a sizable amount of sodium in soft drinks as well.45mg is sizable ? why can ’ t you admit the main problem with soda is the 40 grams of sugar ? i didn ’ t say 40g of sugar aren ’ t a problem . i ’ m saying that isolated sugar is unpalatable and non-addictive unless combined with other agents . we tend not to eat plain sugar but use it to make other substances palatable . it ’ s the synergistic combinations that are the real problem.okay , i ’ m confused . i have pre-diabetes from decades of following a grain-heavy vegan diet , so i now strictly limit my grain consumption , almost down to zero . i currently get about 35 % of my calories from fatty plant-based foods ( nut butters , avocados , etc . ) . this has helped me drop my high glucose levels well into the normal range , cause for celebration ! but all these fats make me a bit nervous , especially given this post . should i be ? am not overweight … hi , russell . yes , you should be concerned … i can assure you that grains cannot and do not cause diabetes.check out this excellent ted talk on diabetes , by dr. neal barnard : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = ktqzm2ia-quin most people ’ s minds ( including medical doctors ) , carbohydrate ( sugar and starch ) is the cause of blood sugar metabolic disorders like diabetes . however , although carbohydrate calories do count , in the sense that the blood sugar goes up right after eating a meal , this is actually normal … and it does not make the underlying disease of diabetes worse . insulin is released from the pancreas after eating , and it causes body cells to take up carbohydrate and fat cells to take up fat ( triglycerides ) .when insulin doesn ’ t work well , the blood sugar rises , and diabetes is diagnosed . in type 2 diabetes , this ineffectiveness is caused by “ insulin resistance ” … which is actually caused by dietary fat , not sugar . the video above explains how fat “ paralyzes ” insulin . diabetics should actually be “ fat-counting , ” not “ carbohydrate counting , ” in order to improve their underlying disease.almost all type-2 diabetics can reverse their disease by minimizing dietary fat . type-1 diabetics will find their insulin needs decreasing by about 30 % when they avoid the fat and add the carbohydrate.thanks laurie , you ’ ve sparked my interest . but here ’ s the thing — if i eat a normal sized bowl of rolled oats , my blood glucose shoots to about 180 and takes five hours to get back to 100 . but if i eat a whole avocado with hemp seeds mixed in , i only spike to 125 , and am down to 85 an hour later . so , you ’ re saying i shouldn ’ t be concerned about the grain-effect upon my glucose ? there are many studies suggesting that any spikes above 140 are damaging to the internal organs . i should ignore those ? it ’ s saturated fat that ’ s implicated in insulin resistance and diabetes , not the mostly unsaturated fat in nuts , seeds , and avocadoes.and you “ know ” this how ? i do not believe the saturated fat in nuts is any different than the one in red meat . if “ fat ” in the cell reduces the ability of insulin to take in the glucose where is your study that says it has to be saturated fat ? i ’ ll work on getting you a reference tomorrow from a college prof.meanwhile , keep in mind there are many different types of fatty acids which collectively compose fat , and there are a number of different saturated fatty acids , some of which are problematic and some which are not . palmitic and myristic acids are considered the most injurious . the jury may still be out on lauric acid.college prof refers me to a google scolar search of “ saturated fat ceramides diabetes ” which reveals a number of studies . sorry disqus isn ’ t accepting my attempts to c & p.sorry , i am not impressed ! you see many food items that people get addicted to like ice cream , red meat and many other items have high levels of saturated fats . even if these things do lead to diabetes it does not mean that other type of fats would not do the same thing if consumed at the same levels . i did not say saturated fat was good nutrition but said there is no proof that it is not any type of fat in the cell that knocks off the insulin … what are you looking for ? incontrovertible proof that 35 % plant fat is healthy ? dr. fuhrman seems to think so . the mediterranean diet is allegedly 40 % fat and healthy.to be “ heart attack proof ” , low fat is ideal to maintain adequate cholesterol numbers . this 2 year study looked at coronary artery lesions of the heart after consuming different types of fat . polyunsaturated fat , monounsaturated fat and saturated fat . they looked at angiograms a year apart after intervening with increasing one type of fat in each group . all 3 fats were associated with a significant increase in new atherosclerosis lesions . most importantly , the growth of these lesions did not stop when polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats were substituted for saturated fats . only by decreasing all fat intake including the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats did the lesions stop growing.http : / / jama.ama-assn.org / content / 263 / 12 / 1646.abstract ? sid = 47d1d016-3c15-43f4-a013-0d10144ef8e3interesting reference going back to 1990 . i would love to see the same study done with ivus.meanwhile , forgive my confusion . it ’ s due to other references i have come across.for example , in dr. greger ’ s newest year in review video , he mentions a patient who resolved his angina with a vegan diet which was not , in fact , a low-fat vegan diet.also , in an interview on npr , dr. steven nissen maintained that a study demonstrated atheroma regression by means of a mediterranean diet . sorry i don ’ t know his source . ( predmed , maybe ? ) russell : if i may jump in here , i believe what is being said is that your blood spike is a symptom not a cause . when you eat a lot of those fatty foods , you are treating the symptom , not the cause . this may seem reasonable , except that the cause of insulin resistance is having a lot of fat in your cells . so , by eating all those fatty foods , you are continuing to make the disease worse . it ’ s not that your blood spike is good . it ’ s that you want to change your diet so that when you eat your bowl of oats , you do not have a dangerous level of blood spike.i think laurie ’ s post was really great . in addition to her information and the video she listed , i recommend taking a look at the following book , which is as great for pre-diabetics as it is for people who already have it : “ dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes : the scientifically proven system for reversing diabetes without drugs ” dr. barnard ’ s diet is 3 times more effective than the ada diet which counts carbs – i believe because dr. barnard is addressing the cause , not the symptoms. http : / / www.amazon.com / neal-barnards-program-reversing-diabetes / dp / 1594868107 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 ? s = books & ie = utf8 & qid = 1414522846 & sr = 1-1 & keywords = barnard + reverse + diabetesone of the reasons i recommend this book for you is not only because you can read the great information at the front of the book at your leisure , but also because there are recipes in the back of the book , plus meal plans . so , you can see for yourself exactly what a diabetes-healthy diet looks like . if you stick with it , your blood spikes should return to normal size.please note : i ’ m not a doctor . i ’ m just a lay person explaining what i ’ ve learned – and so many people have reported experiencing . plus , it ’ s not just anecdotes . dr. barnard has published clinical research on this . it ’ s worth checking out.thea , thanks for your comments , and to others as well for jumping in . just to clarify , insulin resistance is not causing my problems with glucose . my recent labs showed that my lp-ir score is only 25 , which is in the bottom quartile of the reference range . in other words , i don ’ t have insulin resistance in my cells , so excess fats are not the cause of my problems metabolizing glucose . the issue is low insulin production . so , it is far more likely that i ’ m not treating a symptom , but the actual problem — the excess glucose . also , a recent carotid scan shows no plaque buildup , so … . just saying … i ’ m concerned about the fats but i don ’ t think that blaming insulin resistance is always going to be the correct answer.aah ! i replied below before i saw this new post … eesh , good luck with it ! and at the same time , i would surmise that reducing your dietary fat might yield superb results in any case . this is vitally important for blood-sugar metabolism and could be even more important in your case , because the last thing you want to do is create insulin resistance … make sense ? i ’ d be very interested to hear how it goes if you try this for a month.just to blow your mind and bust your paradigms … check out this website from a type 1 diabetic ( who obviously has the same insulin production problem ) … you won ’ t believe what happened when she dropped the fat : http : / / www.healingdiabeteswithfruit.com / laurie : awesome posts in this thread . thanks so much ! russell : oh . thank you for the clarification.sounds like more of a typical type 1 problem than at type 2 problem ? ? ? i don ’ t have much to say on that one – other than , i don ’ t think there is any reason to believe this statement is true : “ i have pre-diabetes from decades of following a grain-heavy vegan diet ” my understanding is that type 1 is an auto-immune response that has nothing to do with eating grains.as for your question about eating a diet that is 35 % fat – i think the worry would be that you might develop type two diabetes to compliment your type 1 . ; - ( i don ’ t know if we have any good data relating fat percents to diabetes . but is a thought : my understanding is that the typical american diet was at one point 40 % and now has gone down some . and type 2 diabetes is still on the rise . does it matter that your fats are all from plant foods ? i don ’ t know … seems like you are in a tough spot . i ’ m definitely not one to give any advice for you . i was just trying to help out with some ideas / analysis that might help you figure out what to do or what questions to ask a doctor.good luck.thea , actually type 2 diabetes doesn ’ t necessarily involve insulin resistance . here ’ s what the mayo clinic says : “ type 2 diabetes , once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes , is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar ( glucose ) , your body ’ s important source of fuel . with type 2 diabetes , your body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn ’ t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level . ” it would appear that i ’ m in the second category.as for diabetes relationship to fat , i just found that in crete , the diet in the 50s was 37 % fat , with stunningly low levels of cardiovascular events ( for many reasons including only 15 lbs / yr / person of sugar intake , the lowest in the world , lots of anti-oxidant veggies , exercise , etc ) . so we know that high fat levels can be okay for the heart if other lifestyle factors are taken care of properly. http : / / www.todaysdietitian.com / newarchives / tdaug2007pg34.shtmland in this bmj study below that i just found , it appears that a typical mediterranean diet like crete ’ s is associated with an 85 % reduction in diabetes. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2427084 / so , i think i ’ ve answered my own question . it appears that a high-fat diet , and even more likely in my view , a high-fat vegan diet , should be extremely healthy for those of us with pre-diabetes , or vascular conditions as well.last point , i can ’ t prove that my heavy grain-based diet caused my condition . perhaps i have late onset type 1 autoimmune diabetes instead . all i know is that i ate tons of pasta , brown rice , quinoa , pizzas , etc . , people were always amazed to watch me eat a 2 lb bowl of whole wheat spaghetti , or a whole pizza with fake cheese by myself . one can overdo anything and even a vegan diet isn ’ t bullet-proof , i believe , if grains or flours are excessive.i think you ’ ve got it exactly . balance your healthy fats , lots of vegies , some whole grains but not too much , berries , some fruits , lots of legumes and some flavorful plant based sauces and you should be good . by the way , it also tastes better than heavy grain and carb . john s pdx ori am in the same boat with you , russell – approaching pre-diabetes despite following a vegan diet and being normal weight . in my case , the pre-diabetes is no doubt the result of decades of sugar addiction . seeing my blood glucose levels shoot up was enough to motivate me to kick the sugar habit and go on the wagon . the higher gi index carbs , like whole wheat breads and potatoes , are also a problem for me . i replaced them with more nuts , seeds , flax , and avocados ( 35 % dietary fat ) , and my total cholesterol dropped 60 points to 126 , a1c is low , and blood glucose levels stay nice and steady . following a vegan diet , exercise , and avoiding oils and high gi carbs seems to be a winner . i question whether the fats in nuts , seeds , and avocados are to be avoided . maybe they have a different effect on our dopamine reward system and insulin resistance than animal fats.suepy , thanks for your feedback . it ’ s nice to know i ’ m not alone in my vegan , low-carb , high-fat diet : ) what i haven ’ t mentioned yet is that my lipid particle sizes are in the ideal range , triglycerides are at 44 , and hdl is at 90 . these are better lipid values than anyone i know . and my a1c is down to 5.3 . i ’ m beginning to think that ine day , this may be considered the most healthful diet in the world . unfortunately , i am not aware of any studies being done on it yet.dr david jenkins , aka the glycemic index guy , has been doing studies using added nuts in the diet and concluded that two ounces of nuts daily as a replacement for carbohydrate foods improved both glycemic control and serum lipids in type 2 diabetes. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 21715526 he also tested a vegan , low-carb ( eco-atkins ) diet and found that it had lipid lowering advantages over a high-carb , low-fat weight loss diet. http : / / bmjopen.bmj.com / content / 4 / 2 / e003505.full i tried the eco-atkins diet and noticed that my energy level was lower , so i added back more healthy carbs – beans , lentils , barley , fruit – which gives me a ratio of 50 % carb , 35 % fat , and 15 % protein . if i do eat some higher gi carbs , then exercising ( fast walk , jumping jacks , stairs ) within 45 minutes will reverse my rising blood glucose down to an acceptable range . let ’ s raise a toast to nuts ! dr. greger has a recent video on ldl particle size . it ’ s mostly irrelevant . large “ fluffy ” or buoyant ldl is not protective or benign . the current consensus is that it ’ s the particle number ( concentration or ldl-p ) in the blood that determines atherogenicity , not particle size.suepy , that ’ s so smart of you to notice that you can eater higher carbs if you exercise almost immediately . i do that too . but it takes me a lot of running to keep just one cliff bar from shooting me up to 150 . my own diet is higher in protein — i rely a lot on seitan , and soy products like tofurky — because lentils and chickpeas send my glucose up a lot too . but otherwise quite similar.i love your thoughts about dopamine and am sure this must relate to the fats . i ’ m far less hungry now than at any other time in my life , and sometimes i just forget to eat . that never would have happened to me when i was on a carb-rich vegan diet . my problem now is finding a way to keep my weight on . a bmi of 20.0 is just a tad too skinny ! how ’ s your weight ? my bmi is 19.4 , no problem keeping weight off . my metabolism seems to have sped up with this higher healthy fat , lower fast carb way of eating . adding lots of fiber rich veggies and a shot of lemon juice while eating carbs also helps keep the glucose level down . have you ever tried chana dal ? it ’ s very low gi and a good substitute for lentils or garbanzos. http : / / www.mendosa.com / chanadal.htmlseitan is great , handles any seasoning or sauce you throw on it . since it ’ s low fat , that leaves more room for nuts ! so , based on a sample of two people , it seems that high-fat , low-carb vegans simply cannot get overweight . sort of the opposite , actually ! you would laugh to look in my fridge — i ’ ve got almond , peanut , cashew , walnut , and chia butter , and i eat them by the spoonful they are great snacks and protein sources ! i ’ ll give the chana dal a try . thanks ! and the lemon juice . you may want to check out dr. greiger ’ s video on amla . i ’ ve been using it , but haven ’ t really done a comparison of before / after , so not positive its working , but i think so … .btw , you ’ re not from the sf bay area , are you ? lots of progressive foodies here … a caveat to eating more nuts , seeds , and avocado : they can ’ t be consumed in addition to crap carbs without causing weight gain . also important is having a source of omega 3 fats , like 2t ground flaxseed , chia , or hemp seeds . i also use very little olive , canola , or whatever oils , instead making my own tofu mayonnaise and oil free dressings , and using water or broth for stir frying.hull-less barley makes a great breakfast cereal , although granted not a fast cooker. http : / / www.mendosa.com / blog / ? p = 138 i boil a big pot of barley on the weekend , put half of it in mason jars to toss in the freezer , and keep the rest in the fridge . for a quick breakfast , add to a cup of cold ( or heated ) barley 1t chia seeds , a handful of raw pumpkin , sesame , sunflower seeds and walnuts or almonds , and a chopped apple or fresh berries . if blood glucose levels are not an issue , add currants , raisins , dried cranberries , or soaked goji berries . yum.sue p. sweet home chicagoyou ’ re a font of helpful information ! i love these ideas , thank you . the only caveat — my dentist told me to stop eating so many nuts because they are grinding down my enamel , lol . so , moderate doses of whole seeds / nuts i guess , and will stick mostly to nut butters.russell , you ’ re welcome ! like you , i was cautious about upping my fat intake while reducing carbs to control glucose levels , especially after reading dr neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes . fats have had a lot of bad press ! i also tried the ornish method ( vegan version ) , but found the very low fat part hard to maintain . fortunately , dr david jenkin ’ s studies are revealing the value of healthy fats , and dr joel fuhrman , although parallel to mcdougall , esselstyn , et al , differs from them in his support of nuts and seeds in the diet.definitely what we need are more studies that examine the health benefits of different whole food plant based diets , tailored to individual metabolisms . meanwhile the proof is in the pudding , via good test results : lipids-check , a1c-check , weight-check , feel great-check.amla , flax , and turmeric took some experimenting to find a palatable delivery method . i don ’ t know if amla is helping – i trust the good dr g ’ s recommendations . isn ’ t there a test for antioxidant levels in the blood ? and speaking of sf , it ’ s home to robert lustig and his great talk sugar : the bitter truth , which points the finger to sugar as the real villain instead of fat. http : / / uctv.tv / shows / sugar-the-bitter-truth-16717whether the fat in nuts and seeds are addictive maybe needs to be examined , but i must admit to a love affair with almonds and pistachios.suepy , the healthy fats issue is going to be controversial for some time . david jenkins , for example , has been shellacked for his conflicts-of-interest , including unilever , bayer , and the nut and soy industries . this link below on the fats issue is fascinating and lays out both sides pretty well ( jenkins ’ conflicts are outlined in the second comment below the article ) . i ’ d love your thoughts on it.http : / / www.happyhealthylonglife.com / happy _ healthy _ long _ life / 2010 / 11 / monounsaturated-fats.htmlfyi , i spoke personally to esselstyn this summer , and he remains adamant that eating nuts and avocados is a terrible choice even for diabetics . on the other hand , denise minger has a story online that seriously attacks his credibility , and it also happens to be quite funny and entertaining . she ’ s not a scientist , but is a young and original mind in the field : http : / / rawfoodsos.com / 2011 / 09 / 22 / forks-over-knives-is-the-science-legit-a-review-and-critique / # more-1487i hope that fuhrmann ’ s view is correct — thanks for sharing that.as for sugar , i agree that minimizing it is important and i rarely eat cane sugar myself , but lustig goes too far . please check out dr. david katz ’ s takedown of lustig in the huffington post . katz is director of the yale prevention research center : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / david-katz-md / sugar-health-evil-toxic _ b _ 850032.htmlthere ’ s lots to chew on here ! russell : hi again . i just had to comment on one more thing . i recommend being very careful about denise minger . she may be young . and she may be “ original ” . but that doesn ’ t mean that she makes any sense , has any real science to back up what she says , or has integrity . to back up what i say : denise also made an attack on plant positive . if you look at plant positive ’ s response to denise , you will see what i mean in terms of my criticisms of denise : http : / / plantpositive.com / display / search ? moduleid = 19496100 & searchquery = denise + minger ( just scroll down until you find the link that starts with his first response and move on if interested . ) just something to think about.thanks thea . yes , i see what you mean and am very disappointed that minger is not speaking in an objective , intellectually rigorous , or impartial way . she appears to have failed to give appropriate credit as well . sorry you ’ ve had to put up with that.nonetheless , her criticisms of esselstyn ’ s original heart study are not completely baseless . in forks without knives , for example , there was a patient with extremely high triglyceride levels , and yet that wasn ’ t considered a cardiovascular problem … why not ? these are very dense , atherogenic particles . easily controlled of course , by limiting carbs … there were also failures to account for patients who dropped out of the study . i ’ d love to see more detail , and explanation , on his studies to help guide our appropriate understanding . do you know if his work was ever published in a peer-reviewed journal ? russell : i don ’ t think minder has very good objections . for example , the patients who dropped out of esselstyn ’ s study were the patients who refused to follow the diet plan . and those patients * were * accounted for . esselstyn takes great care to show that he followed those patients by showing the stats of those drop-outs compared to the stats of the patients who followed esselstyn ’ s diet . ( those drop outs went on to have future heart attacks , including dying . ) those drop out patients were essentially the control group . it was great that there was drop outs so that we would have that comparison data.re : “ do you know if his work was ever published in a peer-reviewed journal ? ” i don ’ t know the details , but the back of esselstyn ’ s book includes a appendix titled “ publications on heart disease by the author ” and includes listings for the american journal of cardiology , the journal of family practice , preventative cardiology , etc . i don ’ t know if those count or not.thanks thea , that ’ s helpful information and i agree with your comment.btw , have you continued to follow this thread ? suepy and i are figuring out all the world ’ s di
75	can one become a sugar addict ? people have chewed coca leaves for at least 8,000 years as a mild stimulant without any evidence of addiction , but when certain components are isolated and concentrated into cocaine , we ’ ve got a problem . the same may be true of sugar — people don ’ t tend to binge on bananas . the isolation of sugar from the whole food may be the reason we ’ re more likely to supersize soda than sweet potatoes , or why we ’ re less likely to eat too much corn on the cob , but can ’ t seem to get enough high fructose corn syrup . the overconsumption of sugar-sweetened diets has often been compared to drug addiction . however , until very recently this parallel was based more on anecdotal evidence than on solid scientific grounds . but now we have pet scans , imaging technology that can measure brain activity . it all started with a publication from the institute of clinical physiology that showed decreased dopamine sensitivity in obese individuals . the heavier they were , the less responsive to dopamine they appeared to be . we see the same reduction in sensitivity in cocaine addicts and alcoholics , which “ would suggest that a reduction in dopamine receptors is associated with addictive behavior irrespective of whether it is due to food or to addictive drugs , as seen in substance abusers . ” dopamine is considered the neurotransmitter primarily involved in the pleasure and reward center of our brain , helping to motivate our drive for things like food , water and sex — all necessary for the perpetuation of our species . it was healthy and adaptive for our primate brains to drive us to eat that banana when there wasn ’ t much food around . but now that fruit is in fruit loop form , this adaptation has “ become a dangerous liability . ” the original coca-cola formulation actually included coca leaf , but now , perhaps , its sugar content may be the addictive stand-in . what about artificial sweeteners ? though some are less harmful than others ( erythritol may be a sweet antioxidant as opposed to aspartame-induced fibromyalgia ) , they could still have adverse effects regardless of their individual chemistry . see my 3-part series : what about fatty foods like meat ? does fat have addictive qualities as well ? good question ! check out my video are fatty foods addictive ? actually , there are vegans out , and a growing group of them , consuming mass quantities of fruit sugar every day , to tune of 10-15 bananas , 20 medjool dates , 2 cantaloupes , a pound of grapes and some greens to even things out . many claim to be thriving on it , but i have to wonder what this massive intake of fruit sugar does to the bodies bacterial environment , so much fructose . fodmaps and such . modern supermarkets and supply chains are allowing this … .. but is this sugar addiction , dopamine-feeding behavior ? of course it feels good to eat 20 medjools throughout the day . throw in a few walnuts and you have a candy bar . anyone have thoughts on this ? i eat tons of fruit like that and for me it works.i so also consume veggies , greens , nuts , and oats but the majority , by far , of my calories are from whole fruit.the whole fruit is probably not much of a problem because you are getting tons of micronutrients and the fiber along with it so i wouldn ’ t just look at fructose from whole fruits from the same perspective as sucrose from added sugars or candies .. if someone was wanting to just juice for fruit and veg intake i would think that going heavier on the veg would be the way to go with fruits being used to give some sweetness and palatability since some veggies are not the best tasting.if the sugars from plant based foods had the same impact on the brain as added refined sugars then we never would have needed candy in the first place . people would just walk by the produce section of a grocery store and start to drool when they see a nice stack of oranges . that doesn ’ t happen . a few walnuts with a bunch of medjools is hardly a candy bar . that is way to macro level and with your focus on the sugar content . sugar by itself may not be a good thing but sugars in whole plant foods come along with so many other things that you need … and you also need the carbs . ” i have to wonder what this massive intake of fruit sugar does to the bodies bacterial environment , so much fructose … ” plant foods , for the most part , are alkalizing to the body . here is an interesting article about ph and various kinds of critters that live in the body.http : / / www.livingwaterhealthsolutions.com / articles / alkalize.phphere is one from dr. greger : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 08 / 05 / test-to-see-if-your-diet-is-alkaline-or-acid-forming / i have nothing to do with that website nor have i ever purchased from them . the article just happens to have a nice combination of information in one place and in a short article regarding acid / alkalinity of the human body.fyi – a food in its natural state being more acidic does not mean that it makes your body more acidic . lemons are acidic but after your body has worked them over , taken the nutrients that it needs , you are left more alkaline . there are lists of foods that alkalize the body all over the internet so don ’ t go away thinking that a food that is acidic in whole form will acidify the body.i find it interesting that some zoos have had to ban chimps from eating bananas as they have become addicted to them . bananas were never as sweet as they are now . they have become man-made creations through our intervention in their growth . food for thought . i think it is easy to stuff one ’ s feelings with 10 medjools , or any other fruit in indulgence , in the absence of hunger.people are not monkeys for starters.also , pointing out exceptions to a rule does not mean that the rule has been disproved.now , seriously , think about all the people that you know . how many have you actually seen getting addicted to a certain fruit ? i don ’ t mean someone that eats an orange or grapefruit everyday at breakfast or has a glass of juice , i want to you to tell us how many people you know that have a date problem or apple problem ? eat even three apples and most people will 1 ) get sick of chewing or 2 ) get so cramped up that they won ’ t do that again.dates – eat enough dates or anything else for that matter , and you get tired of the flavor pretty quick . now , sugar can be addicting for some people but there are other things in foods that people get hooked on , almost always it is the bad for you foods . fats and sugars , grilled flavors , etc . people get hooked on candy bars , pizza , soda , ice cream and garbage like that way more than someone gets hooked on fruits.i have never , ever , known anyone that was addicted to fruit . over the course of my life time up to this point , i would bet that 90 % of everyone i have known didn ’ t eat enough fruit ( of course veggies , greens , beans , etc ) .people with a sugar problem don ’ t turn to fruit . they will get in their car and go to the gas station and fill up their 64oz cup for $ 1.00 or buy cupcakes from the grocery store.as far as the chimps go – more than likely they chimps liked them so much they would fight over them . you have a grocery store , cupboards , etc . chimps get fed on a schedule . most everyone in the industrial world can eat when they want and what they want . chimps don ’ t have that luxury.i agree with you . fruits are far more satiating than liquid calories from a drink or a high energy desert.i agree with most of what you are saying , but i just got through eating 4 good sized red delicious apples and i did not get sick of chewing or cramped . i also had 3 bananas some raw peanuts and almonds along with some organic lettuce from my garden and 2 sticks of celery . i enjoyed my meal and feel just fine . i will have a veggie meal at lunch with beans and barley.big : you used to eating like that . additionally , you did not get that much sugar or calories . four apples ( depending on size ) has about the same calories as what most people drink in their soda at taco bell but you got a bunch of good for you micro-nutrients along the way.the rest of your meal , still plant based , looks like you maybe pushed 750 calories total with the apples , which is about right if you eat 3 meals and a couple of snacks per day.my smoothies are over 800 calories , contain 5 ounces leafy greens , almost 2 pounds fruit , maybe an ounce of nuts and a tablespoon of mrp just to make sure i don ’ t miss out on anything.i wish i had a garden though ! next place we live we are planning on dedicating a room with a southern facing window for edible plants and possibly a couple of mini-trees like the short lemon trees and maybe a fruiting avocado tree if we can find one . a table of tomatoes , strawberries , and kale for sure . carrots and potatoes are supposed to be easy to grow indoors as well.i have to agree with rutter that our modern fruit creations are not really natural fruit . if you eat crabapples , quince , american persimmons , medlar , hawthornes or any other kind of fruit that has not been bred so heavily , you will be fine eating a lot of fruit . our modern heavily bred fruit are a little bit like candy , with grossly oversized fructose and carbohydrates . jo robinson explains it in “ eating on the wild side . ” when i started to eat more plant based i was doing a lot of green smoothies and the high fruit content really made me feel unbalanced . sometimes i still have a banana / peanut butter smoothie since the nuts balance things out a bit , but for the most part i don ’ t drink them any more despite the purported benefits.i eat a lot of fruit also and do much better when the fruit is not blended. i just eat it whole . usually with some nuts and greens like lettuce or spinach from my organic garden.i eat around 2600 calories a day and maybe 1800-2000 come from fruits . i drink around 60 oz of fruit smoothies a day made with bananas , dates , and strawberries mostly . i also snack on bananas throughout the day . i have my veggie juices in the morning , and some quinoa and peas , or some split pea soup , or garbanzo bean salad in the evening . i eat 5-6 times a day . i have been eating this way for three years and i can say the bad bacteria and any viruses in my body have been put in check . i haven ’ t been sick in three years since i adopted a plant based diet and before that i suffered from nasal and chest congestion and would constantly have a cold or flu . i had pneumonia several times also . all signs of sickness is gone . i do stick to alkaline and alkaline forming fruits , vegetables , nuts , and i minimize my legume and grain intake . i keep my fluid ph @ 7.5 this way . i think about it like this . if you didn ’ t live in an industrialized country and your country was full of vegetation , what would your diet naturally consist of ? the easiest thing to acquire is fruits , and the next easiest is vegetables . nuts , legumes , and grains take more preparation . hunting animals is the most time consuming and most dangerous.thank you for sharing this . i found it very helpful . do you eat any gluten-grains ? i struggle to gain weight and put on muscle no matter how much fruit i eat . quinoa , no matter how many times i rinse it and soak it , irritates my gut to in the worst way . i eat beans and nails get brittle , hair goes more grey ( anti-nutrients ? ) starches from grains give me good energy , but i get real bloated and have massive cravings for them within 12 hours.i don ’ t eat common wheat because it is now a completely gmo crop . i think people have a problem with gluten grains now because it is gmo . i eat grains like kamut , spelt , tef , and rye . if you eat the bread you also have to look at the ingredients the are made with because often other grains and additive an preservatives will be added in , and you should avoid those products . as far as legumes go , i mostly only eat garbanzo beans and green peas and i don ’ t have a problem with brittle nails . i stay away from other legumes . not all plant based foods are equal . i minimize my starch intake from legumes and grains . the bloating feeling you are getting from grain consumption is likely do the the gmo and processing of the grain that effect it gluten makeup which causes digestive issues.sounds like your digestive problems are likely caused by chronic dehydration . try really hydrating up consistently and see if those same foods are actually fine for you . 3-5 liters a day is healthy for most adults ( per 24hr period ) .as long as it is whole foods , nothing refined … the more the merrier ! i have days that i eat nothing but fruit all day and it works , but it must be whole foods and non gmo is a must ! fyi nf : except for the links provided along with the article or the video , it ’ s hard to find my way around this web site ! the a-z index seems strait forward enough but often times , the key words in the video aren ’ t indexed in the look up database . what ’ s the logic of doing a search ? it ’ s not a simple matter of typing in a plant or disease ’ s name and getting all the related information . the video titles are creative and grab attention but so often , when dr. greger says , i ’ ll tell that in tomorrow ’ s video . ” , i don ’ t have a clue how to find the follow-up video . it ’ s my opinion someone ( not me ) doesn ’ t understand relational databases . if these key words are added to the database as the stories / videos are created ( and automatically indexed ) , the information is easily availably by searching with numerous cross references . as is , it takes luck and determination to do any research on a specific subject . it ’ s easy to get lost in all the interesting videos looking for the one ( or two ) you need.i ’ m incredibly grateful for the vast quantity of great , digestible information that has been pulled together into this web site , in articles and videos . i also wish searching were a little more helpful . but , given that the site is free , i don ’ t think i can really complain . i can put in some effort . i totally hear you though . i ’ ve had many occasions when i was unable to find a video that might have said something very interesting that was off-topic to the video , but i want to hear it again . one issue i ’ ve found is that the search tool searches for any page with any of the search keywords , in any order , instead of giving priority to pages that have both the search keywords . for example , if i search for “ join pain ” , i might get a bunch of pages that just have the word “ pain ” in them , and nothing about joints , let alone joint pain . that ’ s just an example though . it would be nice to be able to have a more advanced search at least . ( and vs or , or containing _ _ _ _ _ but not containing _ _ _ _ _ , for example . would be so , so nice.this site is invaluable , douglas . like you , i appreciate all that it is . what i am suggesting has more to do with competent database knowledge than expensive programming . i ’ ve searched on the exact title of a video and not got a hit . a key word brings up several hits but not the one i ’ m seeking . i then resort to a visual scan of the graphics for each and every video until i see one that interests me . i ’ ve even found groups of common videos but the one i need isn ’ t in that grouping . it ’ s like several folks have access to the file cabinet and each has her own filing system . it makes me want to eat red meat ! i have to wonder if they are using a “ flat file ” database . if so it ’ s 20 years out of date . however , if they are truly using a “ relational database ” then the programmer is in way over her head . i used to trade stocks fulltime and my trading software of choice was perfect in every way , except it was a dog … that ’ s d o g ! i contacted the company and made them aware of what was possible and they in fact , switched to a relational database and a skilled programmer . as a result the stock trading software morphed into a speed demon overnight . someone who skillfully creates a website isn ’ t likely a database guru too . this site needs that touch.when i view a video from the library and dr. greger ends it saying , “ i ’ ll cover that in tomorrow ’ s video . ” i ’ d like to look up the referenced video by date or name or topic . “ tomorrow ’ s video ” is not a good key search word . the solution is more about understanding what a good database can do than about money.i ’ ll copy and paste our little conversation and make an official feedbacklarry : not to invalidate any of your main points , i thought you would want to know that there is a “ next video ” ( along with a ‘ previous video ” ) link underneath each video on the right side of the screen . so , if you want to see “ tomorrow ’ s video ” and you are not looking at the very latest video , then you already have a quick link to it without having to do any searches.thea , i guess you ’ re saying that works for library videos … thanks . if today ’ s video , for example , is to have a follow-up video tomorrow , the link would not be created today ? but would be present once the follow-up video is released ? i ’ ll pay closer attention next time . as is , the next day i may be away from my computer so catch up on videos a couple days later . by then i ’ ve forgotten to look for the follow-up.my overall critique is valid . i used to teach seminars and we targeted each quadrant of the usa with mailings . the database had millions of companies and their data stored on cd ’ s . i could do a search on my home computer and find the thirty thousand i wanted to mail to in two-tenths of one second . for your application a from can be developed that lists all the parameters ( data fields ) a search query will sort on . those words are linked to the database files and all the videos they are applicable to . it ’ s pretty sophisticated … gets into “ parent-child ” fields and is pre-indexed so is lightning fast . you have an invaluable tool for research here but access is limited to folks like myself who will spend the time ferreting out the good stuff . it ’ s a shame to accumulate all that info and not have immediate access to it . think about it.you are preaching to the choir here . i ’ ve submitted similar sentiments / requests myself . ( i ’ m just a volunteer and have no influence myself . ) i ’ ll make sure your comments get forwarded to the nf staff.fyi : my guess is : being a non-profit site with limited funding , there may not be much that can be done right now . but hopefully this important issue will be put on a list for future improvements for the site when funding becomes available.thank you for your posts.thea , not to beat a dead horse , but to be perfectly clear , i don ’ think upgrading your database knowledge and practices would break the bank . it ’ s more about understanding what is possible , what is “ normal ” , what is needed , for a modern web site to catalog it ’ s objects . it ’ s about joining the 21st century . the money ’ s already being spent . it ’ s about spending it wisely … that is , on a skilled professional database guru , not just an afterthought . the non-profit has a rembrandt painting its pictures so deserves someone equally skilled to catalog its art . what if the great artist locked all his works in a vault and only a few crafty determined people could break in ? if a bank tracked your personal money on the par it would be closed by the federal government … and you wouldn ’ t be content waiting for “ future improvements ” . it wouldn ’ t cost anything to explore what is possible now . with that under the non-profits ’ belt , “ intelligent ” decisions and , if need be , budgeting can be achieved.really , really think about it . y ’ all must be running out of hiding places for the videos.hmmmm. what would it cost to revert to the previous version of nf.org ? macsmiley : i am guessing that that ’ s not an option for a variety of reasons . plus , there were some big search problems under the old site too . so , that wouldn ’ t be the fix for this particular bug.on the plus side : i do know these comments are being listened to . if you have anything specific to add , i ’ ll be sure to pass that on too.thanks for all your participation on this site.lol “ makes me want to eat red meat ” lol ! ! i have to disagree with dr. greger on this one.we only have one pleasure center in the brain , which is a normal survival mechanism , so it is no surprise that hyper-palatable foods would light it up like a christmas tree.if sugar all by itself were addictive , however , people would be downing 5 pound bags of cane sugar by the spoonful or mainlining gallon jugs of karo corn syrup . but that is not what happens.look at the image above . what do you see ? do you see plain sugar ? or do you see candy ? candy is sugar + flavorings . ( remember pixie stix ? ) candy bars , cakes , and cookies are all a combination of sugar + salt + fat + starch and / or protein . food manufacturers owned by tobacco companies know how to engineer combinations of these ingredients for maximum repeat business.michael moss ’ s book salt , sugar , fat is enlightening in this regard.however , when dr. hyman claims that sugar is worse than heroin , or when dr. lustig asserts that fructose is toxic , that ’ s just sensationalistic , inaccurate fearmongering . anyone who has been or have loved ones who have been ensnared by true substance abuse should be offended by this hyperbolic anti-sugar hysteria.it doesn ’ t take five pounds of heroin for an addict to get her fix . why do you believe so much is needed for a refined sugar fix ? the illustration isn ’ t science , it ’ s just “ eye candy ” ( no pun intended ) . since refined sugar ( under any name ) isn ’ t usually injected singularly , what illustration , if any , would be acceptable ? refined sugar water ? a bag of glucose ? jug of corn syrup ? a relatively small percentage of our population is addicted to heroin as compared to sugar . of course sugar isn ’ t the only processed supplement added to food to induce glutinous mass consumption , but it ’ s one of the main triggers causing our epidemic obesity . are there others ? sure ! you may disagree with dr. greger but the science does not.i disagree with you on that . many more people are addicted to sugar , fructose , etc than heroin . it just destroys and kills at a slower rate . @ larry and big alyou are not understanding me , people.the video is entitled can one become a sugar addict , * not * can one become an addict of junk food of which sugar is one of several finely-tuned crucial components.the premise is that various types of sugar , be it glucose , fructose , maltose , lactose , etc. ad infinitum , is addictive because it has been isolated from its fibrous plant source , just like cocaine and heroin . if that were true , people would be uncontrollably gorging on spoonful after spoonful of pure , unadulterated white cane sugar . they ’ d be drowning their sorrows in undiluted corn syrup and pouring large quantities of honey down their gullets.but that ’ s not what happens . people binge on oreo cookies and ice cream not jack frost and c & h. why ? because pure sugar is not inherently addictive.there ’ s no black market in developed countries for iv bags of glucose / dextrose and ringer ’ s lactase solution . why ? because pure sugar is not inherently addictive.when hostess filed for bankruptcy , boxes of twinkies were sold on ebay for exorbitant prices to frantic bidders . why ? because pure sugar is addictive ? no , because if dominos had filed for bankruptcy , nothing of the sort would have happened to yellow 5 pound bags of sugar.meanwhile , a drug does not have to be divorced from its plant source to have a mind-altering effect . case in point : nicotine . tobacco is sold and consumed in whole form . case in point : thc . because pot-spiked brownies.by the way , both the japanese , cubans , and venezuelans eat large amounts of sugar , yet they are not obese . without an excess of calories , sugar is a relatively innocuous substance.meanwhile , there ’ s a whole industry-backed campaign to absolve saturated fat of any guilt in contributing to heart disease , diabetes , and obesity.here ’ s an image from one of plant positive ’ s videos , and a few from alan aragon ’ s presentation yesterday.macsmiley : that was a helpful clarification . i hadn ’ t thought of it that way before . thanks for taking the time to make your point again . ( and sorry you were having so much trouble with disqus today ) it doesn ’ t look like my images got uploaded to disqus . let ’ s try again.wonderful , 4 hours later , all images finally showed up in all their resplendent redundancy . : - / more anti-carb ( sugar ) research and a sample of what lchf / anti-sugar proponents are eating … sorry for the doubles . i don ’ t know what the problem is with disqus these days.thanks for the link , lot of good info on that site .. unlike this one : ) which link ? does high fruit consumption promote higher triglyceride levels ( and thus a worse blood lipid profile , thus more risk for heart disease ) ? no it doesn ’ t . i eat a plant-based diet and i eat around 1800-2000 calories of fruit a day . i have very low triglyceride levels . now if you are eating a lot of fruits plus a lot of refined sugar , and animal-based protein , and refined foods high in refined sugar and fat , then you may have a problem.crystalized fructose is the lowest item on the glycemic index , so fruit doesn ’ t tend to raise triglycerides unless one is in a positive energy balance , overweight or obese.yes it is addictive – i know because i ’ m having a devil of a time quitting sugar even though i know it is not good for me . i ’ ve gone between hours and days , but always fall back into the rabbit hole . i also hide my habit and my spouse thinks i eat really well but doesn ’ t know the real story . dr. gregor – perhaps you could do a video or article on kicking the sugar addiction for good ? i ’ ve never been addicted to anything else before but i can ’ t quit sugar by myself.melanie – are you eating sugar by the spoonfuls or foods high in sugar ? exactly . people are blaming one particular substance , one ingredient and / or one macronutrient for the synergistic effect of multiple ingredients.after all , even bill cosby knows that chocolate cake is made of wheat and eggs and milk ! ; -phttp : / / youtu.be / zuamlbq2aw4if a person wants to make a food rule to avoid foods high in sugar to control caloric intake , be my guest . but just don ’ t insist it ’ s only the sugar that ’ s the problem.sugar on oliver show : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = mepxbjjsnxsfunny stuff.i ’ ve been obese all my life and a true sugar junkie . i have lately joined the ‘ nutritarian ’ lifestyle with dr. joel fuhrman and e has educated me and transformed my life . he then brought me to this website and i continue to learn so much more and everything reinforces dr. fuhrman and i am learning to heed all the warnings . don ’ t get me wrong , it takes time to become a nutritarian after years of abuse , but i suggest getting rid of all the sugar in your diet first . and don ’ t fall for vegan junk food either . i lost 186 # and counting ( its been only 7mos ) ! thanks guys ( the doctors ) ! congrats ! could refined carbohydrates such as breads also cause an addiction ? and if so , is it due to the sugar in these carbohydrates that makes them addictive ? or , do carbohydrates release their own ‘ happy hormones ’ that make them addictive ? i ’ ve noticed that the less sugar i eat , the less i crave it as much . definitely similar to addiction.that must be why people need more and more sugar to feel the same highs , much like drug addictions. abdominal fat , addiction , alcohol , body fat , brain waves , coca cola , cocaine , dopamine , fat , fruit , obesity , processed foods , soda , sugar - -
76	where are phosphate additives found ? in my videos phosphate additives in meat purge and cola and phosphate additives in chicken , i talked about the danger of phosphate and phosphate additives , and how phosphates are often added to chicken and turkey to help preserve the meat . but how often is poultry injected with phosphates ? the vast majority of chicken products ( more than 90 % ) were found to contain these additives . however , most packages did not list the additives on their label . sometimes they call the phosphate additives “ flavorings ” or “ broth , ” and sometimes the labels don ’ t say anything at all . in the video , how to avoid phosphate additives , you can see the different ways phosphate additives have been listed ( if they are listed at all ) on ingredient labels . i ’ d recommend minimizing one ’ s intake of anything with the four letters : “ phos ” . these additives are also used in junk foods and fast food . some products have phosphorus and aluminum additives . we see this a lot in processed cheeses . one grilled cheese sandwich may exceed the world health organization ’ s provisional tolerable daily intake of aluminum by 428 % . ( i ’ ve previously touched on the aluminum in cheese in aluminum in vaccines vs. food ) . more concerning , though , are the levels of lead in some venison ( filled full of lead ) and mercury in tuna ( the effect of canned tuna on future wages ) . the food industry no longer has to list phosphorus content on the nutrition facts label . there have been calls from the public health community to mandate that phosphorus content of foods be included back on the nutrition facts label , but i ’ m not holding my breath . all these studies bring home the same strong message , “ phosphorus-containing additives are present in most meat products and significantly increase the phosphorus content . moreover , the lack of this information in the nutrition facts labels and even in nutrition databases prevents patients and dietitians from accurately estimating the phosphorus content of their food and their daily intake . ” phosphates , yet another reason to not eat meat . too bad tonight ’ s news is more likely to inform us about new research that finds chocolate or wine is beneficial to our health . combine the two and you can skip eating greens.of topic , but my curiosity is peaked , rachael ray just chopped up some bacon for yet another meal her hubby loves . that repeating theme is directed al all women to cook it because hubby wants it . anyway , she commented , “ let all the fat drain off while it cooks . ” has dr. greger done a video on how much fat remains after rachael cooks all the fat out ? is that our problem , we don ’ t cook meat enough ? the idea of letting “ all the fat ” drain is misleading . it is possible to melt and drain the large visible veins of fat running through a cut of meat , but that is hardly “ all the fat ” . there is fat inside the muscle cells as well that is not removed . for example , according to the usda , a 400 calorie top sirloin beef steak -with fat trimmed to 0 ″ and broiled- still contains 18.6 g of fat . by calorie , that steak is about 41 % fat . “ misleading ” ? it ’ s downright deceptive and consistent with media ’ s defiance of nutritional science to stay in favor of advertisers . yesterday i met a talkative lady who shared she had diabetes , type ii . i gently suggested she could improve her health if she didn ’ t eat meat and dairy . she claimed she tried the weight loss regimen and eating healthy but it didn ’ t work … she lost weight but still has the disease . i ask what her typical food was each day and she replied , ‘ subway ” . i ask three different ways what was on her sub and she never told me . her husband volunteered , “ salami ” lol she would tell me what she ate for her other meals either . i only ask because she kept insisting weight loss didn ’ t help diabetes … she “ knew ” because she tried it . i told her about this web site and dr. mcdougall three times . she feigned interest but didn ’ t write either down . all this supports my opinion that as long as selling nutritionally unregulated food is so profitable in the usa , most folks will indulge themselves . they wouldn ’ t cook at home and send a kit = d to the store because they needed this or that chemical to finish the meal . but people do escape responsibility for what they put in their mouths by eating at restaurants . the diabetic woman by her resistance to saying out loud what was other sub sandwich revealed to me she knew she was not eating healthy . too many think taking doctors orders and the pills is the way to deal with the illness . federal law should state , “ upon diagnoses with a fatal disease , residence of this country are required to attend one month of reality nutrition school and reappear before a federal judge with a signed certificate form drs ’ greger or mcdougall showing successful completion . btw , one has to wonder how much fat is in the 400 calorie steak before it ’ s “ all cooked out ” as rachael ray likes ot say . i ’ d still like to know how much fat is in bacon after it ’ s cooked.what about organic meat ? does it still contain phosphate additives ? “ organic meat ” whatever that is , even without phosphates , is unhealthy.sounds like you do not eat meat at all , but i do eat organic chicken and pork ( as well as wild caught fish ) .whole foods states that organic chicken , for example , “ must be fed certified organic feed for their entire lives . organic feed cannot contain animal by-products , antibiotics or genetically engineered grains and cannot be grown using persistent pesticides or chemical fertilizers . it is prohibited to give drugs , antibiotics and hormones to organic birds ” .this would imply that organic chicken is better for you than non-organic . but i wonder whether phosphate additives can still be legally added . does anyone know ? hi janet b.correct , i don ’ t eat “ meat ” … that means any muscle … red , white , poultry , or fish.since “ organic meat ” may not have the contaminants found in typical animals slaughtered for mass distribution , so , free of those , it ’ s best to consider whether meat by itself is beneficial to your family ’ s health . is it ? i don ’ t understand what is gained nutritionally by eating meat . has it ever been prescribed by a doctor for any illness ? my understanding is knowledgeable medical doctors advise against eating meat and dairy when their patients want to avoid cancer , heart disease , osteoporosis , and type ii diabetes . they “ prescribe , greens , fruit , veggies , and whole grains but not meat or dairy . why is that ? as i remarked yest , my oncologist refused to admit that i could be a vegan after my radiation treatments . she told me to eat animal protein ! that is a u.s. doctor at m.d. anderson.a friend of mine lost her husband to prostate cancer . his doctor ( at one of the nation ’ s premier clinics ) told him not to eat flaxseed as it was bad for prostate cancer . he avoided red meat and instead ate lots of poultry . the food police are all around us . they infuse the airwaves with false nutritional information and indoctrinate us to believe the nutritional nonsense bombarded by media . too bad all americans aren ’ t wired to nutritionalfacts.org and some of the other medical doctors who devote their lives ’ and careers to debunking the misinformation we ’ re overwhelmed with daily . it ’ s notillegal to lie about food values.that ’ s too bad , sorry to hear . flax is one of the most beneficial inclusions in a diet for preventing these hormone dependent diseases . its really unbelievable how the myth that flax is bad in these situations continues to spread . then again , dr. ’ s do not get nutrition education . i am unsure if even that would be enough , as current rd ’ s are not taught this either.i am sorry , but disagree about the reason of the ¨ ingnorance ¨ of the drs . i truly believe that greed plays a huge role in this , some docs are in the pockets of the pharmas , get kickbacks , add names to the studies ( for drugs ) that are false , get $ for surgery when there are healthy life style choices , etc . on my last visit to the oncologist for my breast cancer , my dr. introduced to me , in his office , the pharma rep ! then prescribed arimidex , an estrogen blocker , which was a product of the rep . they offered to help me get a reduced rate on the drug , prescribed for 5 years ! i went to the pharmacy , the damned thing was 10 $ a pill , to be taken every day . and no generic . yes , i got my eyes opened on this deal alright . and have never trusted a doctor since , and probably will not . i was an idiot to have stayed in the room , and should have refused to pay for the visit.i ´ m still mad about it , and that was almost 5 years ago . oh , after reading the side effects , etc . i opted out.please see here regarding dr. ’ s and nutrition http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / doctors-nutritional-ignorance / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 11 / 14 / nutrition-education-in-medicine-a-doctor-a-day-keeps-the-apples-away / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / medical-school-nutrition-education / i think most dr. ’ s are well intentioned people who genuinely believe they are making a difference . i am sure there are some bad apples out there , and i don ’ t know if the same passion lasts through out the entire careerhow can a medical doctor be “ well intentioned ” when knowledge is available and she turns her head away ? even worse , any medical doctor i ’ ve ever discussed nutrition with challenges the benefits of a plant based diet and the avoidance of meat and dairy . they like to claim it ’ s the patients fault because they won ’ t eat a plant based diet .. their passion is to be successful , which is measured by profits.doctors are taught to be evidence based , if those specific doctors are open minded enough , sharing some papers would be useful.we can agree that any topic we pick can be proved or disproved by papers we find on the internet . should each doctor be “ educated ” based on whichever bias they were exposed to ? doctor ignorance is a stray issue . the obstacle between good health and good nutritional knowledge is fear of a dip in our gross national product .. politicians careers are based on statistical numbers and perception . they ’ re elections are financed ( and sabatoged0 by lobbyists who dictate even what the government ’ s food pyramid is made of . it ’ s about money and power . people are motivated by some combination of needs . for “ power ” “ affiliation ” and “ achievement ” . those with a strong need for power go into low , teaching , sales , preaching , education , politics , and medicine , it ’ s a mistake to believe they think like folks with a strong need for achievement or affiliation . they don ’ t . most don ’ t go into politics because they aren ’ t interested ( in power ) . yet others campaign to be high school class president . their motivational type is established early.medical students are spoon fed information . they don ’ t indipendantly prove or disprove all they are taught . once they are medical doctors their bias is set.well , i can tell you that , in my experience , they may not have studied nutrition at all , but they sure studied 1 ) medicare billing 2 ) how to spend 2min 2 seconds with a patient , 3 ) how to entice patients to more tests , etc. like they did my mom 4 ) how to cheat on mcare ( i spent about 7 min with a nurse practitioner , she billed one hour , one on one . i called the billing people , they said , “ oh , we know how to do the billing so you don ’ t get charged personally ” ) . 5 ) how to keep a patient who wants to get rid of her breathing machine when she wants to get rid of it . 6 ) how to get your buddies to submit a bill in the o.r. for passing thru while you ’ re out of it 7 ) how to generate extra income , perks from the big pharmas , lobbyists 8 ) how to order jillions of unnessary tests and more . they probably have a class in med school called “ accounting ” .no , we ’ re in a new generation of doctors , health professionals now.jackie , you put it very well . thanks . some doctors are so arrogant they don ’ t know some patients see how greedy and incompetent they are so look at them with disgust . they would argue patients won ’ t eat healthy . locally ( dayton , oh ) , we have a chiropractor who does a one-hour radio show every saturday and he always bolster his own ego by jabbering about traveling around teaching medical doctors “ nutrition . ” it ’ s funny , he faults the medical doctors for much of what the rest of us are critical about , but then he teaches them meat and dairy are healthy foods . someone in his family owns a vitamin store so he always advises a group of vitamins to treat whatever the callers need help for . most often it ’ s about money and ego . one simple solution would be to have a “ medical ” or health school where doctors are trained to keep people well . i think they would have a thriving business saving millions form the other doctors . but if they are taught what other md ’ s are taught with a couple nutrition courses thrown in , their motive and incentive is to practice conventional medicine . somewhere dr. greger ( i believe ) mentioned obamacare covers “ wellness ” care outside of hospitals . i ’ l like to learn more about that . for example , what was available before obamacare , and how it ’ s different now . if “ wellness : is covered then i can understand why rush limbaugh and big business is opposed to obamacare . they ’ re opposed to you and me being healthy.amen. they have to pay for those univ and med school loans some way or other , right ? and … publish or perish . this sob oncologist gave my mother option of chemo and radiation , when she only had weeks to live . cancer wide-spread , everywhere . he told her “ you can have a miracle ” . she opted yes , and the first chemo treatment put her in the hospital . he “ changed the receipt ” for the next treatment , and again , she couldn ’ t even get home . that was the end of that . the radiation burned her skin . for what ? one day longer ? of being sick , throwing up . and how much $ did he make off that little venture ? and then my own little horrible episode with the oncologist . no , not the same one . their favorite line ” you want to do everything you can ” to prevent recurrence , don ’ t you ? well , they don ’ t tell you the side effects.sadly , jackie , medical doctors peddle futile , expensive , painful treatment under the guise of “ giving hope ” .what if all ill people had a george baily moment ( “ it ’ s a wonderful life ” ) and they could look back and see how their life would have been different without meat and dairy . people undiagnosed say they want to eat meat and dairy to “ enjoy life ” . what do they say in their final moments ? i doubt any think it was worth it.toxins , agreed , myths keep most from eating healthy . and true , doctors aren ’ t educated in nutrition ( that ’ s on purpose ) . but not having an education on nutrition does not explain away why a medical doctor advises his patient that flaxseed is harmful to treating prostate cancer . “ i don ’ t know ” seems more appropriate.last time i told a medical doctor i was vegan he ask ’ “ why ” . the same doctor wanted to replace my knee because i had swelling and a click in my knee . his diagnosis was “ arthritis ” and claimed i didn ’ t have pain because my mind suppressed it . the symptoms i described to him have been the same for thirty years … since my military days . nothing had gotten worse , just an occasional swelling and stiffness . if it ’ s caused by arthritis today what caused the exact same symptoms back then ? i went to another doctor who said “ you need no surgery ” . i suppose medical doctors who actually know nutrition aren ’ t likely comfortable practicing medicine in the usual manner . the rest are in denial.if all medical doctors were educated on nutrition they ’ d be obligated to help their patients differently … to avoid disease and illness . how do you suppose that would affect their industry ? larry that ’ s a very cynical view . imagine all the medical students right now . do you really believe that each one of them is doing it exclusively to make money at any cost ? most of these people are well intentioned and want to help people . yes they want to make money ( dont we all ) but they feel this is a noble way of doing it . the problem is not that every doctor knows about the efficacy of diet and lives in fear of the word getting out , they simply do not know the power of diet . they are not taught this , how can they know ? toxins , that ’ s a very naïve view . medical students are a far cry from practicing physicians . but even they have visions of sugar plums .. you keep defending them claiming ignorance of nutrition . i ’ m saying they choose to be ignorant . the medical board and the academics who set the curriculum for a medical degree are doctors . do you suppose all the medical doctors who know this stuff are hiding it from the rest ? read john mcdougall , md . he tells about being a medical student in michigan asking his profs if food played any part in health . that question always irritated the powers that be . finally he was taken aside and told if he wanted to have a successful practice to forget al the nonsense about nutrition and health because his success was based on writing prescriptions for high blood pressure medicine.he graduated and did his internship in hawaii and noticed the older asians were healthy and the younger one were not . the difference was the old world diet of rice and the new world diet of american food . he also noticed healthy asians who moved to hawaii and changed to americanized eating got american diseases.over thirty years ago dr. mcdougall “ discovered ” in his own practice he could take patients off high blood pressure meds by removing meat and dairy from their diet . funny thing , he had a great mentor who knew it thirty years before him . even i know about those experiences so the problem can ’ t be dr. mcdougall , and dr. greger , and other dedicated doctors are hiding the science.my own personal experience found me conversing with two nurses just before minor surgery to remove a “ cyst ” from my neck . they were shocked my pulse was in the fifties and my bp was 114 over ( whatever ) . they ask why i was so healthy and i told them i didn ’ t eat meat and dairy and i rode my bike 15 miles most days . apparently they told the surgeon because as i laid face down on a table and he was starting his incision ( with the two nurses in the room ) he ask , “ to what do you owe your excellent health ? i ’ m not one to argue with a knife to my neck and i sensed he wasn ’ t really interested so i said , , “ oh , i don ’ t know . to shut him up. he insisted on continuing … ” are you married … do you have children … what is your job ? ” he concluded my “ excellent health ” was a result of no stress in my life . the doctor never ask “ how long have you been a vegan ? ” he was satisfied that he convinced nurses diet isn ’ t a health determinant . funny thing , this was in a “ seventh day adventist ” hospital where they are suppose to be particular about what they eat . it ’ s hard for me to imagine doctors aren ’ t questioned by patients about nutrition . illness is big business . in my opinion you have too much faith in the integrity of doctors . like dr . mcdougall , and others say , doctors are great for lancing boils , setting bones , and treating illnesses after the disease but they don ’ t make money preventing disease.what do i know ? not much . i ’ m just parroting what medical doctors say about their own kind . why don ’ t you convince them the other doctors don ’ t have access to the same nutritional science . dr. mcdougall fought for several years ( or longer ) to get a bill passed in california requiring medical students to have one little class on nutrition . after he got it passed i phoned my representative and suggested a similar bill and was told he wouldn ’ t do that because it would “ cost jobs ” .enough “ truth ” is known to not eat meat and dairy . that change alone would eliminate 100 % of heart disease . ( from clogged arteries . ) other countries don ’ t have heart disease . their medical schools don ’ t even teach students to diagnose heart disease . american medical doctors are selectively stupid.i would think your goal is to maintain an optimal immune system and help heal , and not put anything in your body that might trigger your illness.toxins from polluted air , polluted food , and polluted water are stored in the fat tissue of the animal . how are you going to keep those toxins out ? that ’ s enough reason not to eat meat even it ’ s organic . this is a big cause of many cancers.i recently ate “ chicken tenderloins ” .. frozen boneless , skinless chicken with ” no hormones or steroids added ” my husband bought and cooked it for us .. so was so proud of the label ( he knows i ’ m a bit picky ) .. the next day i was as sick as i am when i ingest msg .. so i checked the label .. no msg .. but it did list sodium phosphates .. so i googled this .. and discovered this is an “ arterial toxin ” .. no wonder my head throbbed .. and my whole body hurt.i emailed the company http : / / www.tenderbird.com .. and blasted them for using something so toxic .. they refunded my money ! and now i know .. thx for this article .. i will be on the lookout for “ broth ” in chickens , also.such deception ! ! you ’ d be well advised to avoid “ chicken ” in chicken . your husband might want to know chicken consumption contributes to prostrate cancer and is as high ( or higher ) in cholesterol as red meat . your body makes all the cholesterol it needs . why tempt fate ? what are the bad effects of phosphates ? that seems to be missing from this clip.i ’ ve been eating frozen oil-free hashbrowns that contain less than 2 % sodium acid pyrophosphate to preserve color . how much of a problem is this ? upsss ! my favorite soy milk has tricalcium phosphate . it seems the food industry add these compounds to almost any processed food : - ( aluminum , animal products , cheese , chicken , dairy , fast food , food additives , industry influence , junk food , meat , poultry , preservatives , processed foods , processed meat , turkey , world health organization - -
79	what to eat to reduce our toxic exposure it is not very common that a single molecule attracts enough interest to merit international scientific conferences of its own . “ ah receptor , ” however , “ belongs to the rare elite of such molecules . ” ah receptors are an important factor in how our immune system works . for background , see my video , the broccoli receptor : our first line of defense . the latest conference offered “ new reports about the way plant-derived compounds in our diet are necessary for a fully functioning immune system of the gut . ” one study in particular out of the journal nature , “ expanded our understanding of how diet impacts immunity and health by showing that a plant-derived nutrient profoundly shapes the capacity for intestinal immune defense . ” and intestinal defense not only protects us against the pathogens we may ingest , but also against toxic chemicals . we ’ re constantly exposed to a wide range of toxins , from such sources as cigarette smoke , exhaust fumes , furnace gases , cooked meat and fish , cow ’ s milk , and even mother ’ s milk ( because of what mothers themselves are exposed to ) as seen in my video counteracting the effects of dioxins through diet . many of these pollutants exert their toxic effects through the ah receptor system . for example , dioxins invade the body mainly through the diet ( where we get more than 90 % of our exposure ) as it concentrates through the food chain , presenting a serious health concern . but there are phytonutrients in fruits , vegetables , tea , red wine , and beans that block the effects of dioxins at levels close to what we find in people ’ s bloodstream . just three apples or about a tablespoon of red onion a day may cut dioxin toxicity in half . and the half-life of these phytonutrients in the body is only about 25 hours , so we have to keep eating these health-promoting foods day after day . at first we just thought that it was only cruciferous vegetables that could dock in these receptors and fend off toxins , but does that make evolutionary sense ? as lora v. hooper from the howard hughes medical institute notes , “ given the variety and flexibility of most mammalian diets , a specific dependence on cruciferous vegetables for optimal intestinal immune function would seem overly restrictive . rather , it seems likely that many other foods contain compounds with similar immune-stimulatory properties . ” indeed , “ the search for foods containing similar immunomodulatory compounds has begun . ” we now know that a wide variety of natural plant compounds can counteract the chemical pollution to which we ’ re all exposed . there is actually one animal product that has also been shown to potentially block the cancer-causing effects of dioxins : camel urine . camel urine — but not cow urine — was found to inhibit the effects of a known carcinogenic chemical . importantly , the researchers emphasize that virgin camel urine showed the highest degree of inhibition , performing better than pregnant camel urine , for example . so the next time our kids don ’ t want to eat their fruits and veggies , we can just say , “ it ’ s either that , or camel pee . ” i report different mechanisms but similar outcomes in plants vs. pesticides and eating green to prevent cancer . so this all suggests a double benefit of eating lower on the food chain , since it would also entail lower exposure to toxic contaminants in the first place ( industrial pollutants in vegans ) . i ’ m still keenly curious to know if these ah receptors benefit from frozen broccoli or if i need to be adding mustard powder to my cruciferous veggies to activate the ah benefit . for a variety of reasons , i ’ m not able to include fresh veggies in my diet and have to rely on frozen , so i really do need to know if i ’ m missing out on this ah benefit . ( why don ’ t i just add the mustard powder anyway , especially for the sulphorophane ? because i can ’ t tolerate the taste . but if i learn that it ’ s required for this ah receptor benefit , i guess i ’ ll just have to make myself enjoy it . ) can you handle any fresh veggies – raw radishes or their leaves ? arugula or watercress ? you don ’ t need much. http : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2013 / 11 / 15 / anti-cancer-recipes-groundbreaking-news-about-crucifers / i want to know who got a grant to study camel urine and who provided the funding . sounds like something the australians would do while drinking way too many beers in the outback ! if you look closely at the study , you will find that all involved were moslems ( alhaider aa1 , el gendy ma , korashy hm , el-kadi ao . ) . there is a great need for moslems to support the practice of drinking camel urine ( some times mixed with camel ’ s milk ) that was prevalent in arabia and was advocated by the prophet of islam . i am surprised dr. greger did not look closely at this and discard this heavily biased study , but i guess the novelty of it was too much for the good doctor to ignore : ) tom , google muhammad and the drinking of camel urine.reviews on medical marijuana would be great . i feel like it qualifies for nutritionfacts because you ingest it ? marijuana known to trigger and / or be directly implicated in causing schizophrenia . i ’ ve known too many people who have stated very clearly that marijuana use directly made them go crazy . not everyone can handle this drug , apparently . and there is science published that has raised valid concerns from a causative standpoint for marijuana triggering schizophrenia . i ’ m not picking a fight ( pro-pot vs. anti-pot ) . no , nothing like that.uh okay … just because it ’ s triggering for some people , doesn ’ t mean it doesn ’ t cure cancer or arthritis or whatever . garlic ’ s really good for you , but triggering for people with gi issues . would still love review of clinical literature on it.arthritis cure … .. i ’ d suggest eliminating all nightshade foods 100 % , as well as well as fried foods ( corn chips are fried ! ) and processed grains such as white rice and other high gi grains.re camel urine in the middle east .. traditionally , each locality uses the food stuffs they have at hand for healing . just as first nations peoples , mongolian nomads and the early egyptians had immense knowledge of local plants and herbs and other organic medical treatments , so did the arab cultures . you may want to know that the earliest treatise on western medicine was written by an arab man , ibn sinner , in the 800 ’ s . western medicine gained enormously from his knowledge . arabs in the 800 ’ s had a highly sophisticated society , immense knowledge of science , mathematics , physics , sound , while europe was in the dark ages , people weren ’ t bathing , and were sick and dying . we inherited our numeral system from them , the basics of astrology , and many other intellectual gifts of wonder . i wouldn ’ t throw out the research on camel urine because the researchers have arabic names.sorry , but even when this isn ’ t on topic i felt it was necessary to reply because a lot of people don ’ t seem to know , that most of what you mention was originated in india , not the arabian peninsula . once they invaded india , as a growing empire , the knowledge reached other places though them.and what was the highly sophisticated society in arabia at the year 800 ? they had the sharia ruling their society.while ancient middle east cultures were advanced , ( pre islamic times ) they fell in economic decadence even before the arrival of islam . no much was left by the time of mohamed , and what remained was destroyed.please do your research before you post something so offensive . pre islamic time the rich used to own slaves they did unspeakable thing to them and the islam came and freed all of the slaves . women were also a property ( slaves used for procreational purposes and entertainment ) . even worse , new born females used to get boiled or buried alive . all that stopped after islam . now i understand why you would think it ’ s a horrible religion but remember every religion had extremist who made their religion look bad . most importantly most of the old arabic medicine was destroyed because of wars that proceeds the islamic time.i said nothing offensive , unless you consider offensive the fact that sharia ( the islamic law code ) ruled the arabian peninsula . i asked you to present proof that it was the highly sophisticated society that you claim . arabia 800 ad , present your data.it was actually you the one with comments like this : “ while europe was in the dark ages , people weren ’ t bathing , and were sick and dying . ” that not only are ignorant myths but clearly there is animosity on your part that i opted not to comment in my previous answer . i only hope that you are not confusing the bubonic plague , which arrived with the mongol invasions from central asia.let ’ s read real mediaevalist experts to know what went on : those terrible middle ages : debunking the myths http : / / www.amazon.com / those-terrible-middle-ages-debunking / dp / 0898707811 / ref = cm _ cr _ pr _ product _ top ?

yes , i provided sources disproving what you claimed.while we are still waiting you to back up your claims with * any * data.1 – 800 ad arabian peninsula , “ a highly sophisticated society . ” prove it.2 – prove your other claim : “ pre islamic time the rich used to own slaves they did unspeakable thing to them and the islam came and freed all of the slaves . women were also a property ( slaves used for procreational purposes and entertainment ) . even worse , new born females used to get boiled or buried alive . all that stopped after islam . ” hard data , prove it . distraction tactics won ’ t work.pretty ironic when women are in fact property in the islamic world . they are slaves per se in their own societies . besides , formal slavery is perfectly lawful under sharia , and practiced today . see mauritania and sudan just to begin . ( i linked at the very least the situation in mauritania , around a quarter of the population are slaves ) of course , they might not apply sharia law to its full extend , and a government might discretionary make it “ unlawful ” but is is perfectly lawful under sharia law . and in practice , they do little to end it.deana , didn ’ t mohammed permit raping of captive women in front of their husbands ? didn ’ t isis do exactly that to yazidi women & then make them into sex slaves ? are there muslim fathers who murder their daughters if they have a relationship outside of marriage ? is that islamic liberation ? are the european women going to isis being used for procreational purposes ? who would boil or bury new born female infants ? would you be talking about arabs ? did any other people do such things ? can you name anything positive about islam ? anything ? actually the people in the arabian peninsula were the first victims of islam . they opposed mohamed , it took him a long time . not to mention the christians , zoroastrians and hebrews there , all of them who didn ’ t convert — once mohamed managed to get the cult going after many years of trying and had enough people — proceed to kill on the spot everyone of those who didn ’ t convert . women and children were taken as slaves for enjoyment.see the beginning of what happened here : aisha and muhammad – the moviethe life of mohammed found in the sira ( his biography ) and the hadith ( his traditions ) is a great story – sex , violence , war , assassinations , rape , spies and secret agents . one of the best known features of the story is his marriage to aisha , aged 6.http : / / www.islam-watch.org / video.htmlnow i can imagine some would be thinking “ but what about the crusades ? ” here we go : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = i _ to-cv94bo & feature = youtu.beyet i find the video lacking because only dealt with a small part of what the islam was doing , we only see the mediterranean there . what was going on in asia is not show . i can imagine would be too much work , see the number of battles just in that region.thule , i appreciate your idea of arabian peninsula residents being mohammed ’ s first victims . i ’ ve actually already seen this clip on jihad vs. crusades ! ! ! it shows islam as being colonialist conquerors while the christians “ merely ” wished to wrest the holy land from muslims . the thing is that spain , france , the vikings , the british , et al made up for lost time later w / their extensive colonies on other people ’ s land around the world ( remember the british attack on the falkland islands ? ? ? ) . the 22 arab countries include the arabization ( read “ ethnic cleansing , ” if you will ) of coptic egypt , berber morocco , algeria , tunis ( the whole maghreb ) , phonecian lebanon , mesopotamian iraq et al & that ’ s not including the 44 muslim nations ! however , in the name of truth , the primitive european christian crusaders who met & battled the more advanced middle eastern muslims ( arabs , kurds , etc . ) returned to europe with more advanced ideas to pushed europe into the renaissance , while the muslims ironically became fossilized , possibly until today . but if you are getting excited about europe somehow being more enlightened , the archives & interviews of east european communism are now available & show east europe communists to not be any less barbaric than muslims . even worse , there are strong & direct links between those eastern european communists ( moscow ) & socialists in western europe ( mitterand & his ilk who ended up running western europe ) . in reading this data it becomes abundantly clear that concerns with human rights was only a ploy to further the agenda of their crushing system . see claire berlinski ’ s a hidden history of evil as well as louis menand ’ s bloc heads : life behind the iron curtain . humanity has to search for new models.while the islam empire had access to knowledge ( by accessing what was in the conquered areas ) , au contraire of what is thought didn ’ t preserve much of it . by the time of the first crusade europe wasn ’ t behind in any way , and what they lacked before was the economics means to face such empire.the renaissance happened as this site candidly puts it : “ as the middle ages wound down , florence ’ s pockets were bulging thanksto its textile industry . by the 15th century , florence was like wall street before the subprime bubble burst : lots of people getting rich , not by perpetually toiling but simply by moving income around . merchants and bankerssuddenly possessed the ability to make it rain like only kings , popes , and unhappy druidic weather-gods could before . they also possessed something entirely novel at this point in human history : the leisure time to appreciate things.so they looked around themselves … and found jack-all to appreciate . they needed something to fill the void until we could get the internet up and running , so they turned to art . sculptures , paintings , and frescoes found a much wider audience than ever before , and artists were suddenly in high demand . we , as a species , were well aware of much of the knowledge attributed to the renaissance . it hadn ’ t necessarily been lost or neglected for thousands of years — we just kind of lump it in as being “ rediscovered ” at the time because there were a lot of new paintings of robust naked women and sketches of death machines coming out . it must have been an era of enlightenment . ” actually the high medieval period had two main characteristics that would lead to the renaissance , money thanks to trade , and cultural splendour . and because of that capacity , the first crusade was feasible . ( not the other way around ) i agree with you fully regarding the european expansionism , and about communism . and yes it is documented how the urrss worked to indoctrinate the world ( subvertly most of the time ) . the topic is very long . amazingly , so long after the fall of the berlin wall , people is still being captivated . problem is most people never read history , and keep falling for the same siren ’ s call . i could recommend a lot of books , but this one stands out ( so many people still revere this mass killer ) http : / / www.amazon.com / mao-unknown-story-jung-chang / dp / 0679746323and for economics and the defence of the individual , the mises institute https : / / mises.org / hell no ! ! ! deana mohiealdeen , it sounds like isis based their raping of married yezidi women they captured on mohammed ’ s personal instructions , do you support mohammed ’ s permission to rape married women as stated here ? the heading of chapter 29 of sahih muslim , a canonical hadith collection , is “ it is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a captive woman after she is purified ( of menses or delivery ) . in case she has a husband , her marriage is abrogated after she becomes captive ” the hadiths in chapter 29 say that after a victory for the muslims at the battle of hanain , and in response to the fact that muhammad ’ s soldiers “ seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women , ” muhammad produced qur ’ an 4 : 24 ’ s statement about slave girls / captive women , and all married women ( are forbidden unto you ) save those ( captives ) whom your right hands possess … deana mohiealdeen : heads up , what do you think is going to happen to arabs & islam when all of the oil reserves in arab countries dry up ? well , notice that the us pays for arab oil in dollars . also notice what happened to the two oil-rich nations who insisted that am pay in gold . one was hussein ’ s iraq , the second was qadhafi ’ s libya . both were invaded by am ! ! ! now , why do you think that happened ? hint , paper dollars can lose value , but gold is a lot more stable . when the oil well runs dry , the arabs will be booted ( most likely by themselves ) back to the prehistoric age.i would have preferred that the bit on camel urine was omitted . we don ’ t need to encourage testing on any more animals . sometimes a bit of humor can do harm.yeah , great news doc … just try finding a virgin camel in these partsguess what day it is ! https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 0t9hv5tjxt4 animal products , apples , beans , beef , breastfeeding , broccoli , cancer , chicken , cruciferous vegetables , dairy , dioxins , fish , fruit , immune function , industrial toxins , meat , onions , phytonutrients , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , red wine , seafood , smoking , tea , turkey , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , wine - -
80	our immune system uses plants to activate gut protection it might seem that our skin is the first line of defense between our insides and the outside world , but our greatest interface with our environment is actually through the lining of our intestines , which covers thousands of square feet . and all that separates our gut from the outer world is a single layer of cells , 50 millionth of a meter thick – less than the thickness of a sheet of paper . compare that to our skin . in the video , the broccoli receptor : our first line of defense , you can see a layer of skin , dozens of protective cells thick , to keep the outside world outside of our bodies . why don ’ t we have multiple layers in our gut wall ? because we need to absorb stuff from food into our body . it ’ s a good idea for our skin to be waterproof , so we don ’ t start leaking , but the lining of our gut has to allow for the absorption of fluids and nutrients . with such a thin , fragile layer between our sterile core and outer chaos , we better have quite a defense system in place . indeed , that ’ s where “ intraepithelial lymphocytes ” come in . intraepithelial lymphocytes serve two functions : they condition and repair that thin barrier , and they provide a front-line defense against intestinal pathogens . these critical cells are covered with ah receptors . ah receptors are like locks , and for decades researchers have been searching for a natural key to fit in these locks to activate those receptors and sustain our immunity . we recently discovered a key : broccoli . cruciferous vegetables — broccoli , kale , cauliflower , cabbage , brussels sprouts — contain a phytonutrient that is transformed by our stomach acid into the key that fits into the ah receptor , stimulating our intraepithelial lymphocytes . in other words , broccoli leads to the activation of our immune foot soldiers . in an editorial about ah receptors and diet , researcher lora v. hooper from the howard hughes medical institute noted , “ from childhood we learn that vegetables are good for us , and most of us eat our veggies without giving much thought to the evidence behind this accepted wisdom or to the mechanisms underlying the purported health-boosting properties of a vegetable-rich diet . ” but now we know that “ specific dietary compounds found at high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli , cauliflower , and cabbage are essential for sustaining intestinal immune function . ” green vegetables are in fact required to maintain a large population of those protective intraepithelial lymphocytes . maybe that ’ s why vegetable intake is associated with lower risk of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis , whereas the more meaty western diet is associated with higher risk of inflammatory bowel diseases . this may be because the activating receptors on our intestinal immune cells are basically sensors of plant-derived phytochemicals . this raises a broader question : why did our immune system evolve this requirement for broccoli and other plant foods ? well , when do we need to boost our intestinal defenses the most ? when we eat ! that ’ s when we may be ingesting pathogens . linking heightened intestinal immune activation to food intake could serve to bolster immunity precisely when it is needed . at the same time , this would allow energy to be conserved in times of food scarcity , since maintaining these defenses takes considerable amounts of energy . why remain at red alert 24 hours a day when we eat only a couple of times a day ? we evolved for millions of years eating mostly weeds — wild plants , dark green leafy vegetables ( or as they were known back then , leaves ) . by using veggies as a signal to upkeep our immune system , our bodies may be bolstering our immune defenses when we most need them . thus , the old recommendation to “ eat your veggies ” has a strong molecular basis . ( did we really evolve eating that many plant foods ? see my video paleolithic lessons ) . this discovery has been all exciting for the drug companies who are looking into ah receptor active pharmaceuticals . “ however , ” as one research team at cambridge concluded , “ rather than developing additional anti-inflammatory drugs , changing diets which are currently highly processed and low in vegetable content , may be a more cost effective way towards health and well-being . ” as remarkable as this story is , it is just the tip of the cruciferous iceberg ! see , for example : how else can we protect our immune function ? exercise ( preserving immune function in athletes with nutritional yeast ) and sleep ( sleep & immunity ) ! given the variety and flexibility of most mammalian diets , a specific dependence on cruciferous vegetables for optimal intestinal immune function would seem overly restrictive , no ? i address that in my video , counteracting the effects of dioxins ok that ’ s it ! i am stocking up on broccoli , cauliflower and cabbage . cabbage in my smoothie ? why not ? savory oatmeal is underrated . steel-cut oats with beans , salsa , flax meal and cilantro is my favorite breakfast . never tried cauliflower … .. and add some turmeric and black pepper during the heating process.kwd : i wanted to thank you for this post ! i was pretty skeptical about how much i would like it . i expected to tolerate it at best . but i needed a new breakfast ( i tend to get burnt out on food pretty quickly ) . so , i gave it a try . and to my surprise , i really like it ! i ate it all last week and so far this week . and i ’ ve had fun experimenting with different salsas . that will help keep the interest level up a little longer for me.just an fyi : i find for myself , that the cilantro is optional in terms of enjoying the dish . but i was able to add ground flaxseed with no problems , making me happy that i was getting flaxseed back in my diet again ( at least for now ) . : - ) yeah ! ! just so you know , your idea has helped someone else.thea , sorry i am just seeing this . i ’ ve been off of disqus for a bit tending to school and some unexpected life issues , but i ’ m back now ! this makes me so happy you tried it and liked it ! many times people will say , “ oh , that sounds good ” but never actually give it a try.regarding the cilantro – yes , i often don ’ t have it on hand and it ’ s tasty without it ( sometimes i also add frozen corn or , if i have time , some sauteed onions ) . it ’ s a great way to break the fast ! kwd : thanks for your reply . i ’ m still enjoying the dish . i keep playing with it . here ’ s what i have been doing lately : > 1 / 2 ( volume of what i want to eat ) cooked steel cut oats > 1 / 2 baked beans – mix it up for interest . i even used trader joes ’ boxed lentils one week > 1-2 t ground flaxseed > generous pinch of amla powder > 1 / 3 or so cups frozen : kale , collards or spinach – whatever i have > salsa to tastei am thrilled that i can add the amla powder and not taste it . i hadn ’ t been eating the amla previously because i had to put in too little in order to not taste it . i just gave up . but i can do a good amount in this dish and because of the salsa ’ s strong taste , i don ’ t taste the amla.also note that i found a commercial salsa with a lot of cilantro already in it . this works great , because i had decided that i didn ’ t like the texture of the dish with the fresh cilantro . so , i add the frozen greens instead , and it ’ s really working for me . which is another great plus , because i have never consistently gotten any leafy greens in me for breakfast before . so , this is a big step . : - ) i can totally see how adding some corn or whatever is on hand would just add more great variety.thanks again ! do the cruciferous veggies need to be precut and / or have mustard powder added to them ( as dr. g ’ s advocated in previous videos ) in order to create the nutrient that becomes the ah receptor keys ? or do you get the same benefit from , say , eating frozen greens and the like that have been pre-cooked ? i rely on frozen foods , so i ’ m keenly interested to know if i ’ m missing out on the benefit of the ah receptor activation.and how long does dr. g suggest we should let crucifers sit after we ’ ve cut them in order for the enzyme to do its magic ? dr. greger has recommended 40 min. of sit time or you can add back the myrosinase. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / second-strategy-to-cooking-broccoli / wow , 40 minutes ? this link says only 5-6 minutes , and suggests sprinkling a little lemon juice on the sliced broccoli before letting it sit : http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = george & dbid = 64please see the video i shared , for maximum production 40 min. may be necessaryso are you saying that if we just cook our veges without letting it sit for the required time we aren ’ t eating healthy ? dr greger ’ s rules about everything just gets too confusing , complicated , to difficult and stressful . let me just enjoy my whole foods plant based unprocessed way of eating , thank you.interesting username , i did not say that . i am talking about sulphorophane specifically . eat broccoli however way you want as long as its not deep fried or dipped in butter.too many rules : re : “ so are you saying that if we just cook our veges without letting it sit for the required time we aren ’ t eating healthy ? ” gosh , no one is saying that at all . here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . note how simple they are : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / “ let me just … ” it sounds like your current diet would fit in quite nicely with dr. greger ’ s recommendations.what is being discussed here is how to tweak a healthy diet to get even more out of it . personally , if i ’ m going to eat broccoli , i want to eat it in a way that will most likely to turn my body into a cancer fighting bio-machine . for some of us , it is interesting and fun to keep making our diets healthier and healthier.but if chopping your broccoli and taking a break before eating it is too complicated for you , it ’ s still healthy to eat the broccoli without the rest break . as dr. greger says , the healthiest way to eat your veggies is the one that gets you to eat the most veggies.sorry , forgot about the diet tweakers . should have remembered that since i really like to read the comments . which are sometimes more interesting than the video or blog . the forgetter or getting sidetracked too easily is what makes 40 minutes difficult.could you tell us which of the sources he cited recommends 40 minutes ? thanks , toxins.should broccoli be crowned “ queen ” of the crucifers ? http : / / zesterdaily.com / cooking / how-to-prepare-broccoli-to-fight-cancer / on a separate subject … .dr greger , would you write an article on blood ph ? i have thought for several years that blood ph does change and that you can keep it ‘ normal ’ by what you eat and reducing stress , etc . i recently read an article by a supposedly medically knowledgeable person that blood ph does not change , that the body acts to keep it constant , and that testing urine / saliva are not an indication of blood ph . also that taking potassium bicarbonate does not do anything , because all food that we eat gets neutralized before it enters the intestines , making the ph of food meaningless . basically this person is saying that the subject of the books “ alkalize or die ” or “ the ph miracle ” is bogus . can you give us the correct facts to sort this out ? thanks ! i would also be interested in dr. greger ’ s take on this . the whole ph thing sounds a little dubious to me , but i ’ m no doctor.dr. greger has covered ph. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / testing-your-diet-with-pee-purple-cabbage / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 08 / 05 / test-to-see-if-your-diet-is-alkaline-or-acid-forming / another plausible theory is that brocolli imitate pathogens so they dont get gobble up.when our stomuch mistake them for pathogens , they go on on the defensive and stop absorbing food . a kind of involuntary diet.plausible theory or hypothesis ?

82	are canned beans as healthy as home cooked ? beans are an essential part of any healthful diet . the federal government recommends about half a cup a day of beans , counting them as both a protein and a vegetable since they have the best of both worlds . beans are excellent sources of fiber , folate , plant protein , plant iron , vitamin b1 , and minerals such as magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , and copper , all while being naturally low in sodium . yet americans don ’ t know beans ! 96 % of americans don ’ t even meet the measly minimum recommended intake of beans , chickpeas , split peas or lentils . the same percentage of americans don ’ t eat their greens every day . two of the healthiest foods on the planet are greens and beans , but hardly anyone even consumes the minimum recommended amount . as a team of researchers from the national cancer institute noted , this is just another “ piece added to the rather disturbing picture that is emerging of a nation ’ s diet in crisis . ” but how should we get our beans ? canned beans are convenient , but are they as nutritious as home-cooked ? and if we do used canned , should we drain them or not ? a recent study published in food and nutrition sciences spilled the beans . in addition to their health benefits , beans are cheap . the researchers did a little bean counting , and a serving of beans costs between ten cents and , if we want to go crazy , 40 cents . the researchers compiled a table , which you can see in my video , canned beans or cooked beans ? , of the cost per serving of beans , both canned and cooked . canned beans cost about three times more than dried beans , but dried beans can take hours to cook , so my family splurges on canned beans , paying the extra 20 cents a serving . nutrition-wise , cooked and canned are about the same , but the sodium content of canned beans can be 100 times that of cooked . draining and rinsing the canned beans can get rid of about half the sodium , but you ’ re also draining and rinsing away some of the nutrition . i recommend , when buying canned beans , to instead get the no-salt added varieties , and to keep and use the bean juice . the bottom line is that beans , regardless of type or form , are a nutrient rich food and should be encouraged as part of an overall healthy diet . concerned about gas ? see my blog post beans and gas : clearing the air . researchers are concerned regarding the bpa-fee cans not being so safe after all , that bpa-free lining has its own bad , harmful properties , possibly compromising human health . the science is obviously starting to raise concerns that this could turn out real bad , that maybe we were worse off with the bpa-free cans ? time for these bean companies to start using glass.http : / / www.scientificamerican.com / article / bpa-replacement-also-alters-hormones / http : / / www.edf.org / health / four-reasons-bpa-free-wont-protect-you ?

for example , whole foods sells a variety of organic beans under their 365 ( inexpensive ) label in 13-ounce cartons . all the convenience of canned without the issues.jp : i did some research on those cartons some time ago and found that they generally have the same chemicals / materials as cans . at least that ’ s what i remember . i don ’ t have the research at my fingertips , but you might want to look into it . i think the topic is under something like : septic cartons ? something like that.i would sure like to see any material on this as i have never been able to find anything . but thanks for the motivation ; i ’ ll try again.aluminum liner inside of the cartons . checked and verified . kind of scary.guest : yes , there is aluminum . but according to the industry , the aluminum does not touch the food . you ( assuming it was you / guest below ) may be right that the aluminum leaches through in the cooking . the issue that concerns me even more is that the layer they admit is touching the food is plastic . even if the plastic is bpa-free , there * seems * ( i ’ m no expert or authority on the subject ) to be more and more evidence that any plastic leaches into food , even when the food and plastic is cold.i looked and can ’ t find the detailed description of aseptic packs that i had read before . however , i did find one , very unreliable , page with some other concerns , including environmental ones , which is a big deal to me too. http : / / www.ehow.com / list _ 7439437 _ disadvantages-aseptic-packaging.htmli don ’ t think we have a definitive answer on the topic . i just feel we have enough information that it would not be wise to think that the aseptic packages are any safer than cans – and * may * even be less so.when i asked the manufacturer how much aluminum leached through , i was told that it met fda or whatever government guidelines . they wouldn ’ t say whether any leached through , and if so how much , just that it was meeting government requirements.re : “ meeting government requirements ” well , that * is * scary ! i agree , since those government requirements are probably not “ zero ” , then i would be that the aluminum does leak through . wow.but then again , is that any worse than cans ? i ’ m not saying cans are healthy either . i ’ m just putting it into perspective.that ’ s a great solution to the bpa issue for some people , but keep in mind millions of people don ’ t have access to a whole foods or anything like it . you can find canned beans anywhere , even a dollar store or gas station , and in many different countries . i just buy dried beans in bulk and pressure cook them , but again , not everyone has access to the kinds of stores with bulk bins . here in texas the local supermarket has bulk bins , but back in maryland it was something one could only find in affluent communities . like beans in cartons . if you ’ re passionate about issues like these , some good topics to read up on are food justice ( access ) and environmental racism ( packaging waste ) .bpa-free only removes bpa , it does not remove the alternative chemicals used in these bpa-free cans . i wonder which is worse for the consumer , bpa-free or bpa-rich cans ? i think ultimately , dried beans in bulk are the answer , especially given ( which was the point i thought i was making in my comment , but i may have rambled a bit ) that millions of people are too poor to be able to take things like bpa into consideration , as they may not have different options available to them . and hopefully when dried becomes the norm , people in these food-scarce communities will have that option , too.http : / / www.foodispower.org / food-deserts / my new pressure cooker has changed my life here in the whole foods-free midwest . i have to allow extra time for soaking ( tho ’ soaked beans do keep in the fridge if i don ’ t get to cooking them ) , but it is so easy and inexpensive for me to cook a few cups of dry beans i buy in bulk . i freeze some in pyrex dishes and keep some in the fridge for immediate use . we eat a lot more beans now as having them on hand makes me think of ways to use them that never occurred to me when i used cans . also makes it faster for me to cook during the week . we love bean tacos , grain / bean salads , hummus , chili , guacamole , quick from-scratch indian dishes ( just saute indian spices , onion , garlic before adding veggies then puree part of the dish in a blender with plain unsweetened soy milk before adding back to pan , then add beans ) , and we even add beans to soups and stir-frys.tomatoes leach even more bpa ( or alternatives like bps ) so i no longer use canned . this year i bought 15 lbs from a local farmer , cleaned , and froze them . will see how that works out . i might learn to can in glass next year . my next goal is learning to make soy milk as i like the unsweetened kind in a plastic-lined aseptic package … not sure if i need a maker ( which tend to have plastic parts ) or if i can make it using a pressure cooker & then straining the milk.moomoo , you should be able to make the soymilk without a dedicated maker , i ’ ve seen a lot of recipes where people just use a blender . cheesecloth works but they also sell little bags popular with folks who make almond milk , and i find that easier to wash and re-use than cheesecloth.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = bodgam9e4bu http : / / www.eatingvibrantly.com / make-no-sew-nut-milk-bag / good luck ! i ’ ve made nut milk in the past , but soymilk is something i ’ m interested in trying soon to save money.some month ago i started doing my own soymilk .. soaking , blending , passing through the cheesecloth , boiling … it.s quick and simple . here , in europe , store bought soymilk is very expansive , not always fortified and sweet as hell .. why are you guys crazy about soymilk. please do some research on soy. it ’ s not a health food as it is being presented to us. go to dr. mercola ’ s website ( mercola.com ) . lots of helpful info. cheers ! dr mercola is not a good resource for information in my opinion . pushes too much meat , dairy and oils . : d i.m an md with a phd in nutrition … so pls believe me i know what to eat . 2 portions per day of soy are a wonderful source of protein and other nutrients . regarding mercola , just one word : bleah ! ! ! the reason to not eat gmo modified soy is because it ’ s sprayed with even stronger doses of chemicals than the non-gmo . a family member works promoting soy . he recommends two servings a day too . but that ’ s his job . four out of five doctors used to recommend camel cigarettes . i ’ m guessing nutritional education on a phd level coincides with government propaganda and lobbyist demands . i ’ ll pass on the soy.larry : you may want to check out the videos on “ soy ” on this site. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = soythe point is : there is lots of strong scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of people eating 2-3 servings of traditional soy products a day . if gmo and pesticides are a concern for you , it ’ s easy to find organic soy in traditional products like tofu and tempeh and soy milk . you certainly don ’ t have to eat soy to be healthy . but just like say flax seed and other special plant foods , it makes sense to make soy part of one ’ s diet – or at least not fear it . it definitely does not make sense to imply to others that there is something wrong with traditional soy.non traditional , heavily processed soy products , like isolated soy protein are a different matter.thea , i was clear to talk about gmo soy ( same applies to any gmo food ) . and it ’ s not that gmo and pesticides are a concern for me . the problem with gmo and pesticides is they cause harm to humans . ( you and me ) . organic soy does not have the problems identified in gmo pesticide drenched soy . everyone should fear gmo pesticide drenched soy . that ’ s mostly what is available in the usa . that ’ s what my friend promotes . the message is that the purpose for creating gmo soy is because the pesticides aren ’ t effective any more. the new stronger , more effective pesticides kill bugs but they also kill plants . for that reason pesticide resistant soy was created , hence the name “ gmo ” . to be clear , gmo soy was created so even stronger chemicals could be sprayed on them . that ’ s why we all should oppose any gmo plant . adding to the problem , when farmers grow organic soy and their crop gets infested with gmo grain from the neighboring farm , the organic farmer gets sued for patent infringement . farmers are forced to grow gmo.thea , i did a search and got about fifteen ( more or less ) videos about soy . without a hint i don ’ t know what you believe i need to learn . i can ’ t watch them all right now . i did see one that suggested in the title that soy can be harmful to thyroids . organic or not , i don ’ t want to harm my thyroid consuming soy . besides , i prefer almond milk on my oatmeal , anyway.it goes without saying , no one should fear organic soy because gmo soy is harmful . however , they might want to view the videos you suggested to see if organic soy might cause problems other than gmo related . the matter never entered my mind until you suggested the videos.here ’ s your hint : a whole bunch of those videos and articles you saw the titles for talk about soy ’ s qualities in preventing cancer as well as remission . only a few entries talk about problems when you over-do traditional soy products.yes , over-doing traditional soy products or including products like isolated soy protein in your diet causes problems . that ’ s why your family member ’ s recommendation of 2 servings of traditional soy foods a day is a good one . and as dr. greger shows , 2-3 servings a day is quite in line with the current scientific evidence . just like flaxseed is very good for fighting cancer , but there is an upper recommended limit . that an upper recommendation exists does not mean that the general person should be worried about the food . not when the recommended amounts have such positive effects on our health.if you looked at the answer to the question about soy and thyroid , you would have seen that soy is like broccoli and flax seed in that respect . surely you don ’ t avoid broccoli and flax seed ? ? ? from dr greger : “ the answer is not to avoid these super healthy foods but to just make sure you get enough iodine . ” re : “ i can ’ t watch them all right now . ” you don ’ t have to watch them all . the point was that there is overwhelming evidence about the health benefits of eating traditional soy products . even looking at the search page shows that . because so many doctors get it wrong and because there is so much confusion in the public in general and even with plant-based people , dr. greger has taken great pains to educate us . that ’ s why there are so many entries on soy , including so much material showing the positive health benefits.please note : this is just something to think about and was my reaction to your overall post in general , but especially the unqualified final sentence of , “ i ’ ll pass on the soy . ” it sure seems like you are not aware of the positive evidence about soy . if this topic doesn ’ t interest you , that ’ s fine . there ’ s no reason not to enjoy your almond milk . that wasn ’ t the point i was making.thea , you posted to me saying some might confuse organic and gmo soy ( words to that effect . rather than lecture me on what videos i should watch and what knowledge i should gleam form them , perhaps you could suggest anyone confused about the two types read what i wrote about “ gmo ” and maybe watch a video or two or three in the nf video library about organic soy . personally i ’ m very clear on the subject and i ’ m not responsible for anyone you imagine might be confused . i don ’ t need to watch any more as i ’ ve watched my fill . to appease you i re-watched two and now you want to take me to task for that . if you want to tell the world about organic soy please do so . i chose gmo soy as my topic , not organic soy or organic corn , or organic anything . i can ’ t cover it all in one brief post any more than dr. greger can . what i accomplished was telling folks why gmo was created . and since i have concerns about my very own and very personal thyroid , i ’ ll pass on the organic too since you brought it up . why would you think i need any guidance about organic soy from you ? simply because you are a fan of organic soy does not mean i am opposed . nor do i group organic soy with gmo soy , any more than i group organic corn with gmo corn . please pick a different battle if you want to make a federal case where none exists . .thea , i took the time to watch two soy videos . one told me beans are twice as effective as soy at reducing cholesterol . the other video said soy can cause goiter problems if you don ’ t get enough iodine . no more goose chases . if you want me to see something in a specific video please provide a link , or at least the name or topic . i already know the benefits of soy . my topic was the harm caused by gmo soy . nothing has changed.an interest in making homemade soymilk is not the same as being “ crazy about soymilk . ” this is the exactly the kind of sensational nonsense that makes mercola untrustworthy.nicole , thanks for sharing that awesome video link ! i just recently got a new vitamix blender and have made really good vanilla almond milk with it . now i will try soy milk , because it will be cheaper to make . i ’ ve been following a wfpb diet for about 2 months , and i am feeling so much better now that i ’ m off all dairy . i love it ! love this video . thank you ! moomoo : great post.fyi : if you find your freezer running out of tomatoes , you can get tomatoes from a jar / glass with the eden brand . they sell them on-line too if your local grocery stores don ’ t carry them . just an idea in case you want a plan b in the future.whole foods cartons have an aluminum liner , aluminum materials imbedded inside the carton . the company that makes these cartons so far has refused to provide to the consumer the amount of aluminum that leaches out during the cooking process . keep in mind , the beans are cooked inside these little cardboard / aluminum cartons . they are not a sturdy cooking pot in themselves . i ’ m inclined to believe that some aluminum is leaching from the thin liner inside the carton . same with the cans . all this water should be ( imho ) rinsed out , and never ingested by humans . hopefully dr. greger will see into this logic and suggest to the viewers here to discard all the juices / liquids inside canned products before consuming the actual food.dr greger after many years of eating beans and cooking them for 2 hours we finally purchased a pressure cooker . the time is down to 35 minutes ! ! ! yes , same here . changed the way we plan and eat meals . big improvement and convenience … and our electric one ’ s timer means i can ’ t burn up another pan letting them go dry.so true ! good to know it ’ s a common problem.i thought i was the only one burning pans ! once i created pure black carbon spheres from lentils , a whole pan full . i had to throw a couple of pans out even ! pressure cooker is a great idea.isn ’ t that just the pits ? i work in my little shop so i used to think i could cook and work at the same time . no way … solution : a slow cooker and a fast cooker , both are fool proof … so far . it took us about 20 + years to get past our joint family stories about exploding cookers ! so far so good.thank you for reminding me about using the pressure cooker for beans . i just bought a new electric pressure cooker i m anxious to use more and can t wait to do beans ! karen , word to the wise , the first time i cooked beans in my new pressure cooker i overfilled the pot with beans and under filled with water . the beans cooked and as they softened they plugged the pressure relief vent so the 15 psi design pressure was exceeded and pressure increased and increased until the lid suddenly exploded off my new pressure cooker . my newly painted kitchen was coated , ceiling , walls , and cabinet doors with a thin paste of beans . even the ceiling fan blades were bean soaked . we had to scrape the walls before repainting . don ’ t over-fill a pressure cooker … but then , maybe that ’ s a guy thing ? i ’ m sorry to hear you had trouble with your pressure cooker . it ’ s counter-intuitive , but in many cases modern stovetop pressure-cookers have more safety features than comparably-priced electronic models . i have a kuhn rikon stovetop model that i love . it has two backup venting sources in the event that the relief valve were to get clogged . here ’ s a link to lots of good info about pressure cooker safety . including why you should * not * take chances using a pressure cooker you find in your grandma ’ s attic ! http : / / missvickie.com / workshop / safety.htmlvl : i have a kuhn rikon too . i love it . i like it so much , i ended up getting three total , different sizes . they are terribly spendy , but i think they are very well suited for beginners , like me . very clear on what to do . and plus , then i ended up with three high-quality pots i can use for regular cooking too . these have become the three pots i use for almost all my cooking , whether i am pressure cooking or not.vl , you might not actually have all that extra protection . in my circumstance i made a mistake overfilling with beans which clogged the pressure vent . five vents would have clogged just the same . redundancy in safety features is generally intended as backup in the event the primary wears out or is defective or fails to do its job . it doesn ’ t protect against my mistake . i solved the problem by purchasing an electronic pressure cooker . it ’ s much safer . the “ manual ” type relies on the operator to modulate the heat source so the water does not get too hot and generate excess steam . you become part of the close loop system . my electronic pressure cooker modulated the heat based on feedback form thermocouples . it continually updates the temps … too high and the heat is lowered . it also monitors the pressure . the new technology only supplies enough heat to heat the water so make just enough steam to maintain pressure set point . i ’ m not of the safety system and the electroni8cs is much more reliable . if i were to accidently overfill the pressure would not build like the manual one did.slider1 , ugggh . i had a similar but not as drastic experience with my first pressure cooker , a small futura … mistakenly tried to cook steel cut oats in it ( need a bigger pressure cooker for this ) . the pressure valve clogged , i panicked and stupidly used the quick release valve to release pressure , in the process spewing a coat of oat paste all over my dog eating his food some four feet away as well as my african violets and everything in between . user error . i ’ ve since moved on to a kuhn rikon which seems much safer and can handle foamy foods.lol , you bring back memories ! luckily neither of us were burned or whacked with a flying lid . i ’ m now very proficient with my electronic pressure cooker … and all it ’ s safety features are a great backup.lol. thx for the advice . yes , probably a guy thing … .hahahai ’ ve been making lentil and split pee “ soup ” in a crock pot ( its more a meal than a soup actually ) , yes it takes longer ( about 5-6 hours on the high setting ) , but it is very convenient way to make batches of soup that you can freeze and eat when you want ( all in glass containers of course ) .veganrunner : i ’ m happy for you . i have a pressure cooker too and i love it.fyi : there are several vegan pressure cookbooks on the market . i really like two of them , with vegetarian cooking under pressure by lorna sass ( it says vegetarian , but really is vegan ) being my favorite . i have made some really delicious dishes following that cookbook . and because of that book , i have seen that the pressure cooker is great for more than just beans and soup – it works great for grains too . just a friendly tip.enjoy your new toy ! yes , the lorna sass cookbook is great . i have another too , by jill nussinow , “ the new fast food ” , it ’ s vegan and has some delicious recipes.kwd : i have that one too ! it is my second favorite , but it is a close second.thanks thea for the cookbook recommendation . i am going to order it.woohoo ! the pressure cooker changed the way we eat too.can a pressure cooker somehow be used to reduce the time it takes to soak dried beans ? at present we buy the cheapest canned black beans and thoroughly rinse ‘ em through a strainer before eating . but would like to go the pressure cooker route.with a pressure cooker you do not need to soak at all . put all your ingredients in the pot and that ’ s it . make sure to set a timer ! 35 minutes for 3 cups dried beans , onion , spices and 4 cups water . of course the bean / water amounts will depend on the cooker size . add salt after cooking if you desire . “ they ” say salt when cooking toughens the bean . so easy because as coacervate mentions i have burned plenty of beans cooked the conventional way.now someone mentioned less nutrients cooked at higher temperature but i haven ’ t had time to check into that . maybe dr greger has read something and he can remember it off the top of his head.yes. lorna sass ( whose books recipes from an ecological kitchen and great vegetarian cooking under pressure are ur-texts for the vegan pressure cooker ) calls her method “ quick soak ” . bring beans ( with a couple inches of water to cover ) to pressure , and then immediately turn off the heat , but don ’ t release the pressure valve . in a little over an hour ( closer to 2 for chick peas ) the beans will be soaked through , though you can test by cutting one in half to see if there ’ s any still dry spot in the middle.i soak them overnight and put them in a crock pot in the morning . what i don ’ t use that night i freeze in the french style working jars , about the size of cans.i wonder if the lining they put into the cans would not be something to avoid . i would have concern about bpa or other products they put into it . so cooked beans would have another advantage . but still i guess it is better to eat canned beans than going for a fast-food : ) the fiber in canned beans is less and bpa cans are not safe ! i see a guest also commented on bpa free , so the recommendation should be dried beans over canned beans ! on days you need a quick meal , no added salt canned beans can be an option as it is definitely better than meat ! that ’ s what i do , only use canned or carton beans as an emergency . slow cooked beans are my first option , pressure cooked beans second best option , then the canned or carton as a last resort.i just read your “ canned beans as healthy as home cooked ” post and like the previous guest commented i found it incredible that you did not even mention the health risks of eating beans – and everything else – that comes in cans due to bpa leaching out of the lining . i would not trust bpa-free cans either as what has replaced bpa in the lining ? how safe is it ? when my wife and i do buy any pre-made foods like tomato sauce , we always opt for the brands packaged in glass jars rather than cans exactly for this reason.agreed , and the time is now for consumers to demand that eden beans offer the consumer beans in glass jars . the only way this will occur is if the vegan consumer advocates , raising awareness . lets just have them cook the beans in a big pot and then pour them into glass jars.i used to buy canned beans for the same reason ( cooking time ) but as i learned more about bpa , packaging waste , etc . i decided to “ splurge ” on a pressure cooker . now they cook in a fraction of the time , with no need for soaking . i just rinse , put it in the pressure cooker , and bam – they ’ re done . it takes anywhere from 10 minutes ( split peas ) to 45 ( chickpeas ) but you don ’ t have to stand over it like a normal cooking pot , so you can do other things while they cook , like prepare a salad or wash dishes . they are so delicious and cheap . i can never go back to canned . it ’ s also great because i can get the dried ones in bulk , so i don ’ t have to take home any garbage . we got an electric cooker instead of the stovetop kind so we can use it anywhere , and because it also has different settings that make it extremely versatile ( rice cooker mode , steamer mode , saute mode , slow cooker mode ) .i have been thinking about getting one of the newer electric pressure cookers that can also be used as a rice cooker and slow cooker . however , every one that i saw had either an aluminum or “ non-stick ” cooking insert . the convenience of the multipurpose electric models is attractive , but i would rather get a stainless steel stove top model than have a toxic cooking insert . do you know of any that have a stainless steel ( or other non-toxic ) cooking insert ? sbccvegan : i don ’ t remember the brand , but i have seen at least one electric / automated pressure cooker that had a plain steel insert . if you look on chef aj ’ s site ( if she has one ) , i ’ m thinking you can find that brand since i heard about it from her at a talk she gave.i also wanted to comment on the concept of electric models being convenient . in my research , i found definite trade-offs , with stove top models being more convenient in some areas and less in others . the stove top models win in these areas : shorter cooking times , which goes with the ability to quick-release . also , serves as a regular cooking pot . and is a pot you can do some sauteing in before adding the rest of the ingredients – so you don ’ t have to dirty two pots / pans . at the end of the process , if what you are cooking isn ’ t quite done , you can just put it back on the regular stove for a little more regular cooking or even put the lid back on . in general , what i read was that the stove top versions allow for more control and are more flexible , not counting the ability to slow-cook , which some of the electric models have and stove top do not.just something to think about . i don ’ t think there is anything wrong with the electric / automatic model at all . i just think that there are trade offs that people are not always aware of . so , i thought i would point a few out in the hopes that would be helpful.i hope you find the electric model you are looking for.electric cookers also have a quick-release option ; the reason stove-top models have faster cook times is because they can be rinsed under cold water in the sink . electric models also have a sauté option ( for the purpose you mentioned ) . one of the cons of the electric models is that they can take longer to heat up , since you can ’ t adjust the heating element . also , since you have to wait for it to get up to heat , it is inconvenient to cook in stages ( start cooking beans , wait , add in rice and cook again ) . i started with a stove-top model and ended with an electric because i liked it better , but it ’ s definitely slower . also , it ’ s not good for camping unless you have some solar generator or something.nicole : thanks for your 2 cents ! since i only have experience with the stove top kind , i can only mention what i have read.i tend to go crazy with kitchen gadgets . and i ’ ve been thinking of trying the electric model myself for comparison . so , it ’ s really interesting that you started with stove top and like the electric one better . that gives me even more impetus to give the electric one a try.nicole : i lost your post above in the shuffle. re : “ also , it ’ s not good for camping unless you have some solar generator or something . ” that reminded me that another reason i liked my stove top model is that i can use it for serious emergencies on my stove tec rocket stove. http : / / stovetecstore.net / so , even if i get an electric model pressure cooker and end up liking it better for normal use , i ’ ll definitely be keeping my stove top model around . i ’ m a big believer in preparing for long term power outages.thanks for those thoughts.mine is called “ instant pot ” and has a stainless steel insert.thanks nicole , thea and b00mer . i did some further investigating and found that this instant pot : http : / / www.amazon.com / instant-pot-ip-lux60-programmable-1000-watt / dp / b0073gin08 was replaced with a newer model : http : / / www.amazon.com / instant-pot-ip-duo60-programmable-generation / dp / b00flywnyq / ref = dp _ ob _ title _ kitchenthe newer model also uses a stainless steel cooking insert , and adds a 7th function – yogurt maker . if that function works for vegan yogurts , it could be a very nice multi-use appliance.i also found two other brands that use stainless steel inserts . gowise , shown here : http : / / www.amazon.com / dp / b00klfu01s ? psc = 1 and secura , shown here : http : / / bestpressurecookerdeals.com / category / pressure-cooker-reviews / so it appears that i have more research to do , to decide which one to purchase , but at least it is possible to find what i want ! thanks again.thanks for sharing your research ! that idea of a yogurt maker has really peaked my interest . cooool.i second nicole ’ s mention of 
84	can eating soy prevent breast cancer ? in my video , increased lifespan from beans , i discuss how beans may be the single most important dietary predictor of a long lifespan . but why do people who eat legumes such as beans , chickpeas , split peas , and lentils live longer ? it may be because men and women who eat legumes have been shown to be lighter , have a slimmer waist , lower blood pressure , lower blood sugars , lower cholesterol , lower triglycerides , and better kidney function . interestingly , bean intake is a better protector against mortality in women than in men . this may be because cancer — especially breast cancer — was the leading killer of women in the population studied . breast cancer survivors who eat soy foods , for example , have a significantly lower likelihood of cancer recurrence . a 2012 review looked at the three studies done to date on the link between soy and breast cancer survival . it showed that women who ate the most soy had a 29 % lower risk of dying from breast cancer and a 36 % lower risk of cancer recurrence . a fourth study has since been published that reaffirms these results . with an average intake of soy phytonutrients above 17 mg / day — the amount found in about a cup of soymilk — the mortality of breast cancer may be reduced by as much as 38 % . in my video , brca breast cancer genes and soy , you can see a five-year survival curve for chinese women with breast cancer . after two years , all of the breast cancer survivors that ate lots of soy were still alive , while only about two-thirds of the women who ate the least amount of soy were alive . after five years , 90 % of the tofu lovers were still alive and kicking , whereas half of the tofu haters had kicked the bucket . there is a similar relationship between breast cancer survival and soy protein intake , as opposed to just soy phytonutrient intake . how does soy so dramatically decrease cancer risk and improve survival ? soy may actually help turn back on women ’ s brca genes . brca is a so-called “ caretaker gene , ” an oncosuppressor ( cancer-suppressing ) gene responsible for dna repair . mutations in this gene can cause a rare form of hereditary breast cancer , popularized by angelina jolie ’ s public decision to undergo a preventive double mastectomy . but only about 5 % of breast cancers run in families ; 95 % of breast cancer victims have fully functional brca genes . so if their dna repair mechanisms are intact , how did breast cancer form , grow , and spread ? it does so by suppressing the expression of the gene through a process called methylation . the gene ’ s fine , but cancer found a way to turn it down or even off , potentially facilitating the metastatic spread of the tumor . and that ’ s where soy may come in . the reason soy intake is associated with increased survival and decreased cancer recurrence may be because the phytonutrients in soy turn back on the brca protection , removing the methyl straightjacket the tumor tried to place on it . to find out if this is indeed the case , a group of researchers put it to the test . in the video mentioned earlier , brca breast cancer genes and soy , you can see normal cells side-by-side with three different types of human breast cancer cells , specially stained so that the expression of brca genes shows up brown . column 1 ( far left ) shows what fully functioning dna repair looks like — what normal breast cells should look like — lots of brown , lots of brca expression . column 2 shows raging breast cancer cells . if you add soy phytonutrients to the cancer ( columns 3 and 4 ) , the brca genes get turned back on and dna repair appears to start ramping back up . although this was at a pretty hefty dose ( equivalent to about a cup of soybeans ) , the results suggest that treatment with soy phytonutrients might reverse dna hypermethylation and restore the expression of the tumor suppressor genes brca1 and brca2 . soy appears to also help with other breast cancer genes as well , and women at increased genetic risk of breast cancer may especially benefit from high soy intake . no matter what genes we inherit , changes in diet can affect dna expression at a genetic level . no matter what bad genetic cards we ’ ve been dealt , we can reshuffle the deck with diet . for examples , see : i ’ ve previously covered the available science in breast cancer survival and soy . other effects detailed in : it may be possible to overdo it , though . see my video how much soy is too much ? i love this information . but every woman i know who has had or has breast cancer is told to avoid all soy . why is this considering the information that is out there ? another antiquated thought pattern from physicians not up on the latest data ? susan : i think you are correct concerning antiquated thought patterns . below is “ the story of soy research ” as i understand it . i don ’ t know how accurate this is , but it is what i have gathered over time : at some point , there were some initial animal studies that suggested soy * might * be bad for humans . but those studies were not done with traditional soy foods . they were done with highly processed isolated soy protein . that ’ s like saying that beets are bad for you , while only testing sugar made from beets . there may have also been some very small number of human studies that also showed a negative effect of soy , but then again – those were done with isolated soy protein , not traditional soy foods like : edamame , tofu , tempeh , and soy milk.on the other hand , we have seen many studies on humans based on traditional soy foods that show a very positive health effect of soy . you can learn about some of those studies on this site : nutritionfacts.org / ? s = soyso , why all the bad press about soy ? i think there are multiple reasons . here are some of what i guess are the big ones : > > > 1 ) sensational story telling by the media is fun and profitable for them . they don ’ t care if they ultimately hurt people ’ s health with their poor “ news ” reporting . news is business in america . ( i can ’ t speak for anywhere else . ) the media is notorious for spreading misinformation about nutritional studies . > > > 2 ) conspiracy theory : i haven ’ t checked it out myself , but i have read that some of the negative publicity about soy was funded by various meat industries . whole soy foods could be seen as competition for meat . > > > 3 ) non-organic soy in america is almost guaranteed to be gmo . those people who think most gmo foods ( as produced today ) are likely to produce negative health outcomes end up equating soy with negative health outcomes . but note that organic soy would not be gmo … what we know is that most doctors get their nutrition information from the media just like most other people . so , it would make sense to me that many doctors still tell women not to eat soy even when the best science contradicts that idea.that ’ s just my take on it , but it does fit with what seems to be happening . and it ’ s so sad too . i have two female relatives with breast cancer who i believe were been given all the wrong information : “ don ’ t eat soy ” and “ eat all the dairy , eggs , and meat you want ” . argh ! ! ! but what can you do ? as a lay person , i ’ m not very comfortable telling people to ignore what their doctor says.100 % this ! from what i have gathered , this is exactly the reasoning that has led to soy getting sch a bad reputation . thank you for detailing it all out . i can ’ t organize well enough to do so . but yes , soy is not at all bad like its made out to be . and watch out for the meat industry , next they ’ ll try to demonize other plant foods like nuts and berries . @ theayou are too humble , you are better formed in nutrition than any of those doctors ( because as you know they not even study it in their careers ) not to mention you are far more up to date in this field , than everyone out there except for dr. greger . : ) he keeps all of us up to date , i really think you should talk to your relatives with breast cancer and if possible , point them to this site too.because if things end up the wrong way , you might be left with the feeling that you should have told them.thule : thank you for your kind reply.you are totally right . it is important to try . and i did . i just did so very gently without pushing . i sent some of dr. greger ’ s excellent blog posts about breast cancer and told them that i had a lot more information if they were interested , but if they were not , i wouldn ’ t send anything else . the response from one was crickets … ( ie , nothing . ) the response from the other was the typical : “ there ’ s so much conflicting information out there . no one knows what is true … i just have to do what my doctor says . ” as frustrating as it was / is , i felt that i had to let it go or damage my relationship with my relatives.i ’ ve come across this attitude as well – it ’ s so frustrating . like you , thea , i just leave it . hopefully i ’ ve planted a seed of information that might take root , if not , well , at least i know i tried … sorry , i know the feeling too . : sjust now i sent more information to my mother regarding arthritis , i lost count on how many times i sent information , but despite she says that is going to change things , she only changes a few thing and i am still waiting for her to try turmeric . she cannot check the videos herself , because she doesn ’ t speak english , so i need to send a translated transcription about each thing.very unfortunate the situation with your relatives , because they are gambling their lives there . i hope they beat the cancer anyway.great reply thea . regarding the gmo issue , this one drives me insane . there is literally no non-organic / gmo tofu option available for purchase in any grocery store in my area . even the commercial meat substitute products i ’ ve seen like pepperoni or sausages seem to always specifically state that they are non-gmo . it appears the gmo soy is being consumed nearly entirely by non-vegans in the form of animals who were fed it , or in [ predominantly non-vegan ] processed foods.the news bit also drives me crazy ! there can be a thousand articles on why and how eggs are bad for you , and not a lick of coverage . then one poorly designed egg industry funded study comes out and poof , news outlets eat it up because it ’ s “ controversy ” , and the public is left with the false notion that one study says this , another says that , it ’ s all contradictory , no way to know the truth , etc . same with the recent high fat / low fat “ research ” . the news will never report on an uncontroversial , overwhelming convergence of evidence because where ’ s the excitement in that ? b00mer : thank you for your reply . i ’ m so often impressed with your responses , that praise from you is very meaningful.i so with you on your two points . they are big pet peeves of mine as well – especially the second one.this reminds me of the study released a couple weeks ago showing that a high carb diet was less effective in weight reduction than the low carb diet. http : / / annals.org / article.aspx ? articleid = 1900694the media jumped on this , but what was actually happening ? both groups never exceeded 16 grams of fiber . this says that the high carb group displaced their calories to a lot of processed junk food , as whole food carbohydrate sources are very high in fiber . another problem is that the high carb group still had 28 % of their calories from fat . even more telling of the quality of both diets is that neither group had any significant change in cholesterol numbers . in addition , the participants were obese , and the low carb group ate 200 calories less hen the high carb group . both groups were unhealthy , and we cannot really extrapolate that a low carb diet is healthier then a high carb diet when the high carb diet is getting most of its calories from processed junk.it was a silling study ! but it and the media does such damage . my patients of course all read the news reports . and when i asked them if they thought 28 % was low fat they couldn ’ t tell me . so how are they supposed to understand any of it other than the headlines they read . travesty ! hi doctor . aren ’ t there certain body types that need meat to actually survive and function properly ? i have heard this many times before , and had to finally get an answer ! thank youjason : i have never seen any good science that says that there are “ body types ” that need meat . i think that idea comes from the infamous pheuso-science presented in the book about eating for your blood type . dr. greger has a video about that concept. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / blood-type-diet-debunked / what is true is that there are some people who are born with a genetic defect where their bodies do not produce one of the non-essential amino acids . in other words , while everyone else ’ s body can produce all the non-essential amino acides , there are some people who need to get one of those amino acids from animal foods or a pill because their body does not create the amino acid . however , this condition is very rare . if i remember correctly , it is estimated that 1 in 400,000 live births have this problem . and it is a genetic defect , not a “ body type . ” dr. greger has a video about this issue too . dr. greger show cased a case study on a boy in israel who got sick when he went vegetarian . ( i couldn ’ t find that video . hopefully you can if you are interested . ) i also saw a video on youtube , ( i can ’ t remember who it was ) , where the speaker speculated that some people who have over-eaten animal products for so long may have actually changed their bodies in such a way that the person is addicted to meat . they may experience withdrawals when they stop eating it . i don ’ t know that this has been studied in any way . i think it was just an idea . but it sparked my imagination . i could totally see how some people would think that they need meat in the same way that a heroine addict thinks they need it . their bodies kind of do … just some thoughts for you . hope that helps.i believe this may be the presentation you ’ re referring to , curing leaky gut syndrome – michael klaper md ( video ) here ’ s the link http : / / www.vegsource.com / news / 2014 / 01 / curing-leaky-gut-syndrome — michael-klaper-md-video.htmlactually it ’ s this video : are failed vegans addicts ? michael klaper md ( video ) http : / / www.vegsource.com / news / 2013 / 12 / are-failed-vegans-addicts-michael-klaper-md-video.htmlthe dude : yes ! thank you ! ! that ’ s the one . ( though the first link was pretty interesting too . ) i ’ ve always avoided soy because i have hypothyroidism and was told to avoid it for that reason . any advice ? hi betsy there doesn ’ t appear to be any research out there to support that belief . but of course after taking your medication you should wait the recommended time before eating and of course before taking any iron or calcium supplement.thanks for that comment … i will research further and see what i can find . i have just kind of assumed i knew the facts after being told that years ago but realize i should look at the research again.before going wfpb my husband bought me a wonderful expresso machine and i was enjoying a morning latte ’ . now that messed with my tsh . had to give it up.i used to have soymilk since my 20 ’ s . i ’ m a vegan , exercise everyday and never go to the doctor for any exam … . i just run far away from the doctors … . but some years ago i realizee my lefth breast was hurting . i stopped the soy milk and the pain went away … i thought was coincidence so i tried 3 more times and each time my left breast would hurt at the same spot … i stopped and i ’ m fine ! ! i don ’ t know what was that because i never consulted a doctor or did mamography … i ’ m 55 years old now , extremelly health and my % body fat is 8.2 … i do compete in paddle board races and do very well. i think is my lifestile but if someone has any idea what was that , please tell me ! ! ! could it be in your head ? there was a recent article about people who thought they were gluten intolerant , and experienced digestion problems . with a double-blind test , the researchers found that regardless of whether the subjects consumed gluten or not , they all reported the same digestion problems.maybe a better way of wording your question , i.e. less dismissive and minimizing then could it be in your head . im going to guess if you are resourceful enough to be reading this site then you ’ re an intelligent adult who knows her body and listened to it . for interests sake my husband had a fibroid cyst on his breast and quite a bit of pain and stopped all soy and reduced dairy and within a few weeks the pain was gone and after about 2 months the cyst or swelling was gone . ive had a similar experience with soy and flax ( a more positive experience ) which has phytoestrogens . i was advised by my doctor that caffeine can also aggravate any type of breast swelling or pain from chest muscle constriction ( as i found out ) .in our heads ? as i said , always possible as there is always a mind body connection to health . does this negate the possibility of a soy connection … my friend who is a breast cancer researcher says , no but we ’ re all entitled to our opinion . research by nature is always in the process of being reviewed and either supported by new studies or not.thank you for your continued focus on cancer prevention , treatment , nutritional and “ alternative ” approaches we can take on our own . i will reiterate the questions below about conflicting information about soy – reputable sources in the alternative media has been reporting for years now , about contraindications for soy consumption and hormone-induced cancers . this was the basis for my complete elimination of soy several years ago , so obviously , in response to this article you have put together , i am now questioning this choice.here ’ s a great page that discusses the anti-soy myths. http : / / zenhabits.net / soy / i came upon it while trying to figure out where all these beliefs come from , and i found that all the anti-soy articles eventually point back to the weston price foundation , if they mention any source at all . all of them ! there ’ s no actual studies that show any of these negative things.what i found particularly odd is that the myth makers keep saying that people in asia hardly consume any soy , and it ’ s almost all fermented . coming from an asian background , i knew that was clearly not true . soy milk , tofu , edamame , etc. have been consumed for hundreds , even thousands of years by a huge amount of the world population and has not caused man boobs , etc . obviously , it doesn ’ t inhibit fertility.guest : nice post and link . thanks.here is an article ( also connected to wp ) on the negative effects of soy although it does note that fermented soy can be beneficial which supports much of what i ’ ve heard in msm ( mainstream media and therefore filtered and skewed for easy assimilation and obviously profits ) and in medical studies . as i mentioned above we have a good friend who researches breast cancer and has worked with some very respected and credible colleagues in that area . her mother died of breast cancer ( as did mine ) and she has had her own scare ( as have i ) so she comes from a both a professional calling as well as personal . she practices staying open to wherever new or interesting info comes from and i respect that as many are not able to stay open and or respect others opinions or beliefs if it doesnt match with theirs . one thing we know for sure … there is still alot we dont know and we dont know what we dont know so better to stay open.i wish anyone dealing with growths in their breast ( a gf currently is ) and or breast cancer ( man or woman ) the very best in their journey and courage to do what they believe is right for their health and recovery.ahh , forgot to include the link to the medical report . well that ’ s what severe lack of sleep from prednisone gets you . apologies , here it is … http : / / www.cambridgemedscience.org / cambsoy % 20fiction.pdf. read my above email to see context . here is a good link on this site http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / breast-cancer-and-constipation / about stool size and breast cancer which others including my pcp found interesting and will be looking for future studies to support . in the meantime we all know good bowel / colon health is really important … right ? good potty habits people . seriously i ended up with longterm issues including elongated colon / bowel , diverticulitis , and pre-cancerous polyps in part im sure from years of chronic constipation . whatever we can do to prevent breast and other cancers along with being aware of new studies on foods like soy is good . educate yourself , dont rely on others.thank you , dr. greger and everyone on the team , as well as well-informed commentators who take the time to respond . what a fabulous site ! the confusion that seems to pop up again and again about soy leads me to suggest a series of blogs and videos : how about gathering the topics that elicit the greatest confusion , blow-back ( cheese and milk proteins ) , etc. and set the record straight , updating where possible ? one we would like to see would be an update on quantities of iodine necessary when drinking daily , say , 30 oz of green drinks with 2 handsful of raw kale , 3 big leaves of raw collards , a ½ or more cup of raw red cabbage ( + fruits ) . our tsh has doubled in our year drinking these delicious smoothies . we eat some nori , and sprinkles of dr. brownstein ’ s organic kelp in the smoothies . but fearing an overdose , as per dr. greger ’ s warning video about kelp , we seem to have underestimated our iodine needs . kevin has gone to steaming the raw cruciferous ingredients , i am increasing my kelp sprinkles instead , because i prefer the raw taste . how to judge ? i read recently that the japanese get an average of 7 mg of iodine a day , mostly from their sea vegetables and they seem not to suffer any harm from it.gayle , your drink sounds amazing ! i admire your commitment . we have a juicer and just got the nutribullet . you ’ ve re-inspired me to take a friends advice and get back to my juices and smoothies to help my body . according to my friend who like you worked hard to get her phd ( women like you will rule the world one day ) , focused on breast cancer research for both personal and academic reasons , it may be hard to set the record straight on soy or get a consensus at this point as even researchers / academics are divided on their opinion . as always you cant ignore the billion $ $ $ plus industry around products and supplements including soy so that will also fuel the one side of the argument . being a high risk for breast cancer and having a friend currently waiting for surgery ( fingers crossed benign ) to remove a lump after a botched initial diagnosis process and my help to get her to a major medical center for a second opinion , im taking the everything in moderation road and keeping things as close to nature and least processed as possible . i stay very tuned into my body ’ s rxn to what i expose it to and open to various sources of information ( even ones i may not agree with to see all sides ) . after that as my husband said , at some point you have just live your life and enjoy it . period . speaking of which it ’ s a beautiful sunny day here so im off to get some air.dr. greger , you oftentimes speak about how soy is a great product , and in the case of this article , how it can be beneficial to women in preventing breast cancer . however , there is much debate going on regarding how a diet high in soy is detrimental to the health of men ( increased estrogen levels and other health damages ) . if you could clear this up for me , i ’ d really appreciate it . thanks ! i enjoy these articles and find the information to be so helpful . however , as a ‘ breast cancer survivor ’ ( diagnosed last year and finished all treatments and ops for now ) , i found the doctors wording ‘ kicked the bucket ’ in reference to the women who died to be in such poor taste and quite disrespectful . please choose your wording more carefully in future , especially when referring to people who unfortunately lost their battle.sorry cait but we are all in the same mortality boat . we are all bound to the same end . i applaud the dr. for giving mr. death zero respect . as a survivor you know your fate.at some stage we all “ pop our cloggs , meet our maker , throw off our mortal coil , push up daisies , go belly up and my personal favourite , go to room temperature ” live long and prosperthank you , well done.hi cait , i agree with what you ’ ve said . not having been personally affected by breast cancer as of yet in this life , i didn ’ t take note of it . but reading it again , and imagining for a moment if i had lost someone i love to breast cancer , or being close to that myself , i can imagine how hurtful that would be . the dr. has a sense of humor , and i think 99 % of the time it ’ s a great quality that lends an engaging and amusing feel to the videos and articles . but sometimes you do get the odd unintentionally insensitive phrasing . i would imagine if he sees these comments he would take it to heart . congratulations on your progress thus far , wishing you good health on your journey.thank god for humor , without it we ’ d live in an even shittier , shit then i could imagine in this world , except for death would be better . humor is often our only life boat for the many discriminated people-many of whom can ’ t even mention their grievances on a board like this one because it ’ s not pc or accepted like breast cancer is . i do feel for all people whom are harmed , often unnecessarily in many ways yet have no voice-thank you god for humor i say.i could never believe that dr. greger meant any disrespect . the comment did strike a loud note with me upon first reading and my thought then was , good for dr. g. not being politically correct nor too respectful of death . yet , i did imaging that some would feel pain at the comment – those who have not an iconoclastic attitude toward life and death . given who i am , i liked the normalizing effect of the comment about death . i often talk about sexuality in dreams and waking life and have decided to do my part to de-mystify , de-mythologize , de-shhh it because the worst parts of sexuality ( abuse , fear , inhibition , infidelity , and stds come largely from the fact that we treat it with kid-gloves . certainly not a position to everyone ’ s liking . so i am sorry that some feelings were hurt , but suggest that you think of dr. greger ’ s personality and work , and consider his likely effort to embolden readers in facing death.humor is a wonderful thing in this world . so is empathy , kindness , and the ability to learn something new every day . no need to choose one over the other.i ’ m sure this is in the discussion below but i read that there was a difference between fermented soy products as the japanese ingest and non-fermented as we typically intake in north america . the latter being not great for several reasons which unfortunately i can ’ t recount off the top of my head . in comparison we also take in way more soy than the japanese diet as it is in many products and drinking soy milk would likely result in over consumption … . just a tidbit some may like to explorehi brad , you can see a guest ’ s post above , the idea that asians are not consuming tofu or edamame is a myth . personally i work with almost all chinese and indian colleagues , many of whom are not even vegetarian , and tofu as well as dishes made with soy sauce are consumed quite often at lunchtime . most asians i have met seem to have an inherent interest in health ; they seem to have been raised in cultures that value traditional medicine ( which is to a large extent nutritional medicine ) . with that said , they seem to consider unfermented soy a health food . my one japanese colleague does use miso , but none of the chinese seem to . i think the only use of tempeh i recall was by a malaysian friend way back in school.also of note , this site promotes a * whole foods * plant based diet , so the “ many products ” containing soy would for the most part not be included or promoted . the only soy consumed in a wfpb diet would then be the soy milk , tofu , edamame , tempeh , etc that is intentionally consumed ; one could include these foods quite often and not be taking in more than the average asian person.i just want to say that i ’ ve been loving the pictures lately . whatever that tofu dish is , it looks delicious . and the baby with the beans was adorable.this is for those wondering if cooking some things is a good idea . many so-called “ anti-nutritional ” factors in raw foods are proteins . they derive their biological activity from their 3 dimensional structure . for example trypsin inhibitors are chains of amino acids that have folded into a shape that fits into the active site of the digestive enzyme trypsin . while this site is blocked the enzyme is inactive and can ’ t digest food.if your raise the temperature of the inhibitor high enough ( say during cooking ) then it changes shape into a random coil or big big gob of goo and it loses its ability to inhibit trypsin . in fact trypsin can then turn the tables and break down the inhibitor ! without wishing to get too long winded , the same principle applies to many protein-based anti-nutrients . people are cautioned against eating raw egg because it contains a protein called avidin . it binds up the vitamin biotin so strongly it is not bio-available . cooking unfolds the avidin rendering it harmless … but that is not a reason to eat eggs ever ! ! there are many examples so if you are hearing some conflicting truths , i would do some googling and try to determine if the thing that concerns you can be “ fixed ” by a little food processing.also , i ’ ve got to add , beware . one person ’ s poison is another ’ s medicine. e.g / the medium chain sugars in soy are often listed as anti-nutritional factors . it comes down to whether you think passing gas vs. promoting good intestinal flora is anti-nutritional . caveat emptor as always.coacervate : this was such a great post ! good for a lay person like me . i had not heard this explained before . thanks ! hi coacervate , you might find these videos discussing the evidence from cooked vs. raw broccoli [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / sometimes-the-enzyme-myth-is-true / ] and [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2 / ] .doctor , please one short video of describing your opinion and research on calorie goals for weightloss , macro ratios and other variables for succesful long term weightloss . i have been following a vegan diet for quite some time. i watch all the videos on here all it says to avoid is meat dairy and eggs. but not really any comprehensive calories , macros and types of foods to eat. thanks if you could do a video.http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / 1476753296 / ref = oh _ aui _ detailpage _ o02 _ s00 ? ie = utf8 & psc = 1 the forks over knives plan : how to transition to the life-saving ,

85	eat beans to live longer beans , beans , they ’ re good for your heart ; the more you eat , the … longer you live ? legumes may be the most important predictor of survival in older people from around the globe . researchers from different institutions looked at five different cohorts in japan , sweden , greece , and australia . of all the food factors they looked at , only one was associated with a longer lifespan across the board : legume intake . whether it was the japanese eating their soy , the swedes eating their brown beans and peas , or those in the mediterranean eating lentils , chickpeas , and white beans , legume intake was associated with an increased lifespan . in fact , it was the only result that was plausible , consistent , and statistically significant from the data across all the populations combined . we ’ re talking an 8 % reduction in risk of death for every 20 gram increase in daily legume intake . that ’ s just two tablespoons worth ! so if a can of beans is 250 grams , and we get 8 % lower mortality for every 20 grams , if we eat a can a day can we live forever ? if , however , one wants to decrease their lifespan , studies suggest eating a bean-free diet may increase our risk of death . having arrived at the one dietary fountain of youth , why aren ’ t people clamoring for beans ? fear of flatulence . so is that the choice we ’ re left with : breaking wind or breaking down ? passing gas or passing on ? turns out that people ’ s concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be exaggerated . a recent study , profiled in my video increased lifespan from beans , involved adding a half-cup of beans every day to people ’ s diets for months to see what would happen . the vast majority of people experienced no symptoms at all . however , a few percent did report increased flatulence , so some individuals may be affected . but most aren ’ t . even among those that were affected , 70 % or more of the participants felt that flatulence dissipated — no pun intended — by the second or third week of bean consumption . so we ’ ve just got to stick with it . and a small percentage reported increased flatulence on the control diet without any beans . people have preconceived notions about beans such that just the expectation of flatulence from eating beans may influence their perceptions of having gas . researchers didn ’ t actually measure farts in this study , they just asked participants how much gas they had . we know from previous studies that if someone eats a product that ’ s labeled to have something that may cause intestinal distress , it causes more intestinal distress — whether it actually contains that ingredient or not ! so people thinking beans are going to cause gas may just be more likely to notice the gas they normally have . either way it tends to go away . after a few weeks of daily bean consumption , people perceive that flatulence occurrence returns to normal levels . in another study , researchers added more than a half a cup of kidney beans to people ’ s daily diets , and the research subjects reported that the discomfort they initially felt within the first day or two quickly disappeared . we ’ ve just got to stick with it . the bottom line is that an increasing body of research supports the benefits of a plant-based diet , and legumes specifically , in the reduction of chronic disease risks . in some people , increased bean consumption may result in more flatulence initially , but it will decrease over time if we just keep it up . doctors should recommend a bean-filled , plant-based diet to their patients , as the nutritional attributes of beans far outweigh the potential for transitory discomfort . the long-term health benefits of bean consumption are great . eating beans in the long term may make our term on earth even longer . i ’ ve previously covered intestinal gas in one of my more amusing blog posts , beans and gas : clearing the air . more on the benefits of beans in : again , very informative and fun to read . how come lentils are mentioned so rarely in your videos and articles ? there are so many videos on beans , but lentils are hardly mentioned at all . why is that ? are beans just that much healthier ? what is the major difference between beans and lentils anyway ? i ’ m just a little confused and clearing the mist for me would be much apprechiated.anyway , thanks for the article . it makes my daily legumes taste even better ! the distinction , for the purposes here , is semantic . lentils and beans are all legumes , and offer very similar benefits.we eat beans every day it does bother us at all we love them.i ’ ve noticed that , although beans are a bit gassy , mine don ’ t smell . tends to make me feel a bit superior . i probably got switched in the hospital with a dukes baby . toot-toot for now … is there a correlation between high levels of carbon dioxide in blood and intake of legumes ? my recent test showed total carbon dioxide of 29 , the normal is between 19-28.i have also had high carbon dioxide level in my blood since switching to a vegan diet . ( my diet as a vegan is much higher in legumes and other plants than before switching ) . anyone else ? more about gas than living longer . i ’ ve never personally noticed beans to be a gasser , but i ’ ve heard the taco bell jokes my whole life . i think any time you mix incompatible food types or eat things that your gut isn ’ t used to digesting you ’ re going to get some disruptive results.dr. g , have you seen any studies that show how beans influence gut microbiota ? to prevent flatulence , soak the bean for 48 hours before cooking them . if you want you can rinse them in between . if not , you ’ ll see a layer of foam appearing on top – that ’ s the saponine that in fact causing the flatulence . so soak for a long period of time , rinse thoroughly , and cook in clean water . works for me.i ’ ll do that . thanks.dr. greger , i recently experience a water fast at true north . while i had great results , my sugar addiction came back and i have gained half of the weight back . well enough is enough , i am training for a bikini competition for july 2015 starting at ground zero and all of these trainers are protein protein protein , supplement , supplement , supplement . i want to train plant based with out all the protein powders and weird supplementation ( bcaa ’ s et all ) am i misinformed or are they ? the training isn ’ t as rigorous as people think : 3-5 45 minute weight training episodes a week a 3 20 minute cardio a week . i eat beans and i eat varied ( when i am not being an addict ) i take a b12 and d3 and that is it . i would love to see a blog post or some sort of information on this ! jodyjosepi : re : ” i want to train plant based with out all the protein powders and weird supplementation … ” i think you are more right than they are . check out the following page about protein . even though it is long-ish , it is worth your time to assure yourself of your protein needs . also note that there is a section on athletes. http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmlas for supplements , check out dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / dr. greger is careful to only recommend fairly well studied supplements because we have so many examples of other supplements causing harm.i think your diet sounds excellent . that said , here are some other resources that may be helpful to you be an athlete an stick to your vegan diet : http : / / www.greatveganathletes.com / http : / / www.plantbuilt.com / when robert cheeke started veganbodybuilding.com in 2002 , being the only vegan athlete he knew of , he may not have imagined that the website would quickly grow to have thousands of members . robert says , “ we ’ re discovering new vegan athletes all the time , from professional and elite levels … to weekend warriors and everyone in between . ” for more info : http : / / www.veganbodybuilding.com / here ’ s a book . i can ’ t speak to it personally . someone else recommended it : thrive : the vegan nutrition guide to optimal performance in sports and life by brendan brazier . his book is exclusively about vegan sports nutrition and contains a variety of great tasting recipes along with a 12-week daily meal plan.hope that helps. aging , beans , chickpeas , chronic diseases , dietary guidelines , elderly , flatulence , greece , japan , legumes , lentils , lifespan , mediterranean diet , mortality , nutrition myths , peas , soy , soybeans - -
86	overdosing on poppy seeds the opium poppy used to make heroin is the same opium poppy used to make muffins and bagels . does this mean that poppy seed muffin we may have had for breakfast contained a powerful narcotic ? the idea that poppy seeds could serve as the source of appreciable amounts of codeine / morphine was not given much credence despite the existence of an old european custom recommending a poppy-seed-filled pacifier to quiet a noisy baby . it wasn ’ t given much credence , that is , until a mother tried giving her six-month-old some strained milk she had boiled some poppy seeds in with the very best intentions of helping the child sleep better . it worked a little too well , culminating in respiratory arrest . now we have governmental warnings that such a practice is not a good idea . the cases aren ’ t limited to children . evidently if we eat spaghetti with a half cup of poppy seeds on top , it can make adults a little loopy as well . so what ’ s the upper limit of poppy seed consumption that ’ s probably safe ? a study profiled in my video , how many poppy seeds is too many ? , suggests about one teaspoon for every seven pounds of body weight . that means that someone weighing about 150 pounds ( 70 kilograms ) should probably eat no more than seven tablespoons of raw poppy seeds at a time . cooking may wipe out half of the morphine and codeine , though , so that gives us some more leeway when baking . soaking the seeds for five minutes first and then discarding the water before adding them to our recipe can eliminate another half if we ’ re making some poppy seed filled pastry or something for kids . otherwise , though , there shouldn ’ t be any risk at usual levels of intake — unless you ’ re going in for a drug test , in which case you may want to avoid poppy seeds altogether . to learn more about not overdoing healthy foods check out these videos : are epsom salts safe for occasional ingestion to relieve constipation ? i ’ ve heard that taking isolated magnesium , in such high amounts is completely unnatural for humans , and can thus cause great harm . wondering if espom salts can also harm the gi tract and its overall integrity . not only is it high in magnesium , but one is ingesting a high dose of sulfur at one time as well.i once tried taking a small amount of epsom salts as a source of magnesium based on a suggestion by ray peat . as i recall it made me nauseated . i do take magnesium up to 500mg / day from magnesium citrate . in my experience the only downside is that if you take too much it will loosen your bowels . i add 1 tsp chia seed to my oatmeal cereal which has a high fiber content . i eat a wfpb diet and should get plenty of magnesium from the quantities of greens that i eat . however i do benefit from the magnesium supplementation perhaps due to the high fiber diet making magnesium more difficult to absorb . “ … high fiber diet making magnesium more difficult to absorb . ” – fascinating . i had no awareness that this fiber content can be detrimental for magnesium absorption.how can i find a previous post i sent — -about 2 weeks ago — is there a way to search my name or by my email ?

87	the healthiest diet for weight control we know that vegetarians tend to be slimmer , but there ’ s a perception that veg diets may somehow be deficient in nutrients . so how ’ s this for a simple study , profiled in my video nutrient-dense approach to weight management : an analysis of the diets of 13,000 people , comparing the nutrient intake of those eating meat to those eating meat-free . they found that those eating vegetarian were getting higher intakes of nearly every nutrient : more fiber , more vitamin a , more vitamin c , more vitamin e , more of the b vitamins ( thiamin , riboflavin , & folate ) , more calcium , more magnesium , more iron , and more potassium . at the same time , they were also eating less of the harmful stuff like saturated fat and cholesterol . and yes , they got enough protein . and some of those nutrients are the ones americans really struggle to get enough of — like fiber , vitamins a , c , and e , calcium , magnesium , potassium — and those eating vegetarian got more of all of them . even so , just because they did better than the standard american diet isn ’ t saying much — they still didn ’ t get as much as they should have . those eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark green leafy vegetables , but that comes out to just two more teaspoons of greens than meat eaters on average every day . in terms of weight management , the vegetarians were consuming , on average , 363 fewer calories every day . that ’ s what people do when they go on a diet and restrict their food intake — but it seemed like that is how vegetarians just ate normally . how sustainable are more plant-based diets long term ? they are among the only type of diet that has been shown to be sustainable long-term , perhaps because not only do people lose weight but they often feel so much better . and there ’ s no calorie counting or portion control . in fact , vegetarians may burn more calories in their sleep . those eating more plant-based diets appear to have an 11 % higher resting metabolic rate . both vegetarians and vegans seem to have a naturally revved up metabolism compared to those eating meat . having said that , the vegetarians in the first study mentioned were also eating eggs and dairy , so while they were significantly slimmer than those eating meat , they were still , on average , overweight . as profiled in my video , thousands of vegans studied , the only dietary pattern associated on average with an ideal body weight was a strictly plant-based one . but at least the study helps to dispel the myth that meat-free diets are somehow nutrient-deficient . in fact , the editor-in-chief of the journal of the american dietetic association asked , “ what could be more nutrient dense than a vegetarian diet ? ” anyone can lose weight in the short term on nearly any diet , but diets don ’ t seem to work in the long-term . that ’ s because we don ’ t need a “ diet ” ; we need a new way of eating that we can comfortably stick with throughout our lives . if that ’ s the case , then we better choose to eat in a way that will most healthfully sustain us . that ’ s why a plant-based diet may offer the best of both worlds . it ’ s the only diet , for example , shown to reverse heart disease – our number one killer – in the majority of patients , as described in my video : one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic . sorry , i don ’ t understand this statement : “ those eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark green leafy vegetables , but that comes out to just two more teaspoons of greens than meat eaters on average every day . ” it seems to contradict itself . is it “ significantly more ” ? or just two teaspoons ? thanks ! “ significant ” is just a scientific way to say that the difference between the meat-eaters and vegetarians was likely not due to random chance . though two teaspoons is not a lot , it was still a “ significant ” difference between the two groups.consider if meat eaters on average ate 0 to 1 teaspoons per day ( and vegos ate 2 more than that ) .i just turned 65 , had a lumpectomy , iort and reconstruction surgery june 4 of this year and i have been eating mostly vegan for a little over three months now and was feeling great at first , but in the last month or so i started having major anxiety and some depression – feels like what i hear about menopause ( which i went through with flying colors years ago ) – sweats , fatigue , stressed , forgetfulness , making crazy mistakes , emotional and my temperature is a little low just around 98 . i am taking b12 and flax seed meal . i am trying to eat all the necessary vegan food groups . what could i be missing ? don ’ t know what it could be besides my diet . i am trying to add back some animal protein to balance me back to be able to start vegan again after doing more research . help ! ! ! you might try taking a quality b complex rather than just b12 since the b vitamins work in symbiosis . i take one made by jarrow that i like a lot.thank you . see my reply above.sorry , they moved my reply to below.first , i want to offer my support . you have been through a lot and taken control of your destiny . what does your doctor say about the anxiety and other symptoms ? one thing that comes to my mind … i have found that getting myself in motion makes all the difference . just some gardening or whatever you enjoy doing just might kick those blues in the keister . ruth heidrich has some good stuff on her site : http : / / www.ruthheidrich.comyou ’ ve come to the right place … there are others here with solid nutrition background to help.best wishes jeannejo . you will beat this.thank you . i responded above.sorry , my reply is now below.jeannejo , maybe your symptoms are caused by low thyroid. http : / / www.womentowomen.com / thyroid-health / hypothyroid-symptoms-2 / one more thing , have you been eating a lot of soy and / or raw cruciferous veggies since becoming vegan ? these and other goitrogenic foods can block the thyroid ’ s production of thyroid hormone , causing hypothyroid symptoms. http : / / chriskresser.com / do-raw-vegetables-hurt-your-thyroid-healththank you . see my reply above.my reply now moved to below – sorry.cut out all grains ( pasta , bagles and breads ) , and vegetable oils ( with the exception of extra virgin olive oil ) , and add in healthy fats , in particular from grass-fed butter ( 10-20g per day ) , grass-fed full-fat yogurt and cheese , and pastured eggs.and i would also add in omega3 supplement with direct dha and epa from algae sources , like the ovega3 based oil ( flax seeds and flax seeds oils are a waste of time and money ) , search on amazon for suitable supplements ( pills and oils ) .omega3 dha and epa fats and the cholesterol ( in the eggs ) are of paramount importance for the health of your brain.b12 supplementation is fine , but the most effective is the methylcobalamin , in sub-lingual films . get the 1000 mcg pills and take one pill every day for a month , then two pills a week for the rest of your life.iron. it does not matter how much iron you have in your veggies if you cannot absorb it. non-heme iron found in veggies is poorly absorbed , especially if your stomach acidity is low and you are well into your adulthood . consider heme-iron supplements , like proferrin , at 10 mcg per pill , once a day , they really restore iron stores in less than three month . and you do not need to care about whether you have food or liquids with tannins , or the acidity of your stomach ( and not an orange juice is not going to cut it ) . and no gi distress , unlike other non-heme iron junk supplements.you can do all this while sticking to a vegetarian diet ( fucking hell , good old vegetarian like we meant it decades ago , not vegan ) , with the exception of proferrin , that is derived from the bovine or porcine blood . but for that matter you can start with common non-heme iron and see how you fare ( get an iron blood panel , check ferritin levels in particular ) .thank you . i will consider all your advice.butterfat and full fat dairy are “ healthy fats ? ” sorry , you seem to be on the wrong web page . the paleo / wheat belly / grain brain aficionado web pages are elsewhere.i am ( lacto-ovo ) vegetarian since 1991 , so go figure … very confusing statements ! did not dr gereger suggested that grounded flax seed oil is the best source of not only omega but a host of other stuff ? ground flax seeds , or flax oil , contains ala , a kind of omega3 fat that our body needs to convert to other kinds of omega3 fats , dha and epa . the conversion ratio is very poor in most people and worsens with aging or excessive omega6 intake ( because there is an enzymatic competition on the pathways for conversion of those fats is forms that usable by our body ) . you might take a skeptic stance on this assertion , as i did for a number of years , but they i had my blood levels of dha and epa checked and they were not at all good , notwithstanding i had plenty of ala in my blood , because i was consuming lots of flax ground seeds and oil ( first class products by the way , organic and properly produced ) . well it turns out that my body does a very poor job at converting ala to epa and dha . my wife as well , while my kids performed a little better . this is in line with research studies indicating a worsening conversion power as we age . nevertheless i did no want to impair the brain and nervous system development of my three kids , as well as risk a dementia myself in my old age , so i turned to a supplement oil with native dha and epa , derived from algae , so it is also vegan , even though we are not vegan in our family . those algae are the same stuff that fish eat to get their omega3 fats , so we cut out the fish in the middle and everyone is happy ; ) do yourself a favor , check your blood levels , everyone of us is different , and most of us need to get reliable epa and dha source . the same goes for the b12.thank you all below who have responded to me – i am not sure how to reply to each of you all at once , so hope this is clear.i will look into taking a b complex like mv coffman recommends . : ) i haven ’ t been back to my gp yet due to just getting medicare ins and not having picked a supplemental ins yet . and i really try to keep in motion like coacervate recommends cuz not moving feels worse , but i am so emotionally drained , i feel like i need a long vacation – lol.i will mention getting my thyroid checked once i get my ins straightened out . yes , i do eat lots of raw cruciferous veggies cuz i thought it was a good thing based on some of dr. greger ’ s videos . thanks julie and for next para : i have not been eating lots of soy tho based on the fact that i had hormone responsive breast cancer , i know dr. greger recommends it , but others do not and i am not sure who is right – sorry dr. g if you read this – i really think you are da best , but i haven ’ t done my homework enough to be sure about soy yet ( altho , i really enjoy soy , esp. tofu – i used to eat it all the time a few years back . – did this contribute to having breast cancer like some suggest ? ) — > could use feedback : i also don ’ t want to take the hormone blocker drugs like femara , tamoxifen and the others my dr ’ s are recommending – i was hoping to avoid them and just medicate via vegan nutrition . : ) just the thought of taking these drugs give me anxiety . : ) i feel stuck between a rock and a hard place – ouch ! hi jeanne , i was going to mention the blocking drugs but i read in the last paragraph you weren ’ t taking them . couldn ’ t it be just your hormones adjusting ? i have never seen any research on thyroid and cruciferous vegetables . and just to make sure i did a pubmed search just now . none-notta-zilch . let me know if you find anything . i am hypothyroid and have never been affected by them.i am not sure why nicola is recommending dairy and cheese ? i can ’ t say that makes sense to me . and eggs ? go above and look under health topics and dr greger has a bunch of videos that you might find helpful . his year in review are great if you haven ’ t already watched them.also before taking iron have it tested . i am sure your doctors are testing these things but either way take a test first.good luck jeanne.hi veganrunner – hormones adjusting to what – to my surgery or to a vegan diet ? ? ? i didn ’ t know about pubmed , i will go there and look around . well , i have actually taken it on myself to add some eggs back to my diet cuz i was feeling so bad and thought i might need a little animal protein . not sure what ’ s right at the moment , i just want to feel better . i will go get tested soon as i get my insurance straightened out . thank you for your comments . jeannehi jeanne , have you tracked your micronutrient intake ? cronometer.com is useful for this . there is nothing in animal protein that you can not get from plant protein . the proportions of individual amino acids are different , though it is the animal based amino acid profile that shows deleterious results in inducing cancer promoting growth factors . it may be helpful to find out if you are actually deficient in any specific nutrients before adding in foods known to contain numerous harmful substances without knowing if they contain anything you actually need . if you track your micronutrient intake and you don ’ t see any deficiencies , then you can at least rule that out . then perhaps a blood panel with tests for vitamin levels to make sure you ’ re in fact absorbing what you consume , along with various hormone levels may help shed some light on the problem.particularly before adding in eggs , you may want to look at the videos regarding arachidonic acid and mood . in addition to cancer promoting methionine content and amino acid profiles , eggs contain inflammatory trans , saturated , and omega 6 fats . eggs that boast high omega 3 content generally come from hens that have been fed flax , so nothing is gained by going through the middle-hen , other than inflammation , cancer and heart disease promotion , and microbial pathogens.all the best . hope your insurance issue doesn ’ t cause too much of a headache , and that you can get some answers and feel better soon.many studies have found that extremely low fat diets are associated with depression . eating some olive oil , avocado , walnut oil , or canola oil in your food may help if you are eating an extremely low fat diet . john s pdx orthank you . i was eating avocados and lots of nuts , so i probably got enough fat , but still … the type of fat also matters , as i said , dha and epa are the ones your brain needs the most and those are not in the above foods . only in oily fish , grass-fed fatty cuts of meats , or grass-fed full-fat diaries , but above all and foremost supplements . and you can find also vegan supplements with dha and epa , derived directly from algae , which is what the fish take it from . so you cut out the man , er , the fish in the middle and go straight to the source , also avoiding possible pollutants ( like pcbs and mercury ) as well as rancid oils.the only catch is that algae based supplement tend to cost three times as much . if you are serious about the reasons for being veg * an , then this should not be an obstacle.here is one such supplement you can get in the ushttp : / / www.amazon.com /

+ epa % 2c + 60 + veggie + softgelsi mentioned above to eat some nuts , but we should not be eating lots of nuts . they can be hard on the digestive system . if you will eat a wide variety of fruits , veggies , nuts , seeds and grains and make sure you are getting enough calories you should be alright . you did say above that you were eating a lot of raw in the cabbage family . i personally from my experience and from what i read it should not affect your thyroid . but if you eat a lot of raw foods you may need more calories . you cannot get enough calories on a lot of raw food without eating a lot of fat and a lot of fat is not good either . hard on the liver . if yo uare not getting sufficient calories then you will not be getting sufficient nutrients.please explain why “ lot of fat ” is “ hard on the liver ” .are you eating enough beans , grains , and nuts and seeds . and maybe you are not eating enough of all the food groups.are you eating enough ? drinking a couple of litres of water a day ? most people who claim to fail at a plant based diet don ’ t eat enough . maybe go get a blood test to see how your b12 levels etc. are . you could also be low in vitamin d.whatever you do , don ’ t listen to nicola ! their just messed up.hi , have you tried using cronometer.com to see which nutrients might potentially be missing from your diet ? also , i would suggest you eat enough carbohydrates , from whole food sources of course , they are definitely a brain food . they also give you a natural high , which makes you far less dependent on stimulants ( coffee , tea , etc . ) for a boost . bananas , dates , potatoes , rice , etc. get enough in , and if you keep your fat intake low , you can really fill up on them without gaining weight . i haven ’ t read john mcdougall ’ s book , the starch solution , yet , but i imagine it to say something similar , he ’ s done a lot of research and he ’ s a physician , whereas i ’ m not : - ) wish you the best.dr. greger , you mentioned that the vegetarians were naturally consuming fewer calories . i would love if you could comment on the success of high-carb low-fat diets such as “ raw till 4 ″ .as we saw with numerous other high-antioxidant and low-fat foods shown in your videos ( i.e. grape juice ) , an increase of calories doesn ’ t always equal an increase of bodily fat . i ’ ve been having great success eating over 3,000 calories a day , mostly coming from fruit , and consuming less than 10 % total calories from fat . if there ’ s any clinical data on this i would love to hear about it.does anyone know of someone who has beat brain stem cancer ? how did they do it ? try dr. mcdougall ’ s site . i did a brain stem cancer search on the site with no results but got some from brain cancer. https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / google-search / this months newsletter ( august ) even dealt with cancer screening risks and hype.my experience as a vegetarian was that we tended to eat a wider variety of foods because i was forced to think outside the “ meat , veggie , potato , salad ” box.still , i was vegetarian for 10 years and never lost a pound , unless i cut calories as well.from jeff novick : if you allow people to eat “ ad libitum ” or all they want till the are comfortably full , from low calorie dense foods , they will lose weight , not be hungry and do not have to count calories.of course , calories still count , but it becomes almost impossible to over consume calories from the foods you choose if you follow these recommendations.these are averagesfresh veggies are around 100 cal / lbfresh fruits around 250-300 cal / lbstarchy veggies / intact whole grains around 450-500 cal / lblegumes around 550-600 cal / lbprocessed grains ( even if their whole grain ) around 1200-1500 cal / lbnuts / seeds around 2800 cal / lboils around 4000 cal / lbwhat they found is if the calorie density of the food is below 400 calories per pound , not matter how much they eat , they all lost weight.between 400-800 calories per pound , with some moderate exercise , they all lost weight.between 800-1200 calories per pound , people gained weight , except for those with very high activity levelsover 1200 calories per pound , everyone gained weight.remember , the physical sensation of “ fullness ” is influenced in a large part by the filling of the stomach and the triggering of the stretch receptors . this would happen regardless of the calorie density of the food , as long as enough food was consumed.however , between 400-800 calories per pound is the range where people either maintained , gained or lost a little . it was the area that i call the “ cut-off ” zone and the results depending on the person and their activity level.these numbers are also inline with other recommendations.the recent wcf / aicr report on cancer recommends that the average calorie density of our diets be around 550-600 calories per pound , to avoid obesity and weight problems.a starch based diet , made up of starchy vegetables and intact whole grains along with some fruit and veggies , will have a calorie density under 500 calories per pound and maybe even 400 calorie per pound . it would be near impossible to overeat.you can also see the problem with many of the “ low fat ” diets that focused on processed whole grains , like whole wheat bread , crackers , dry cereals . at 1200-1500 calories per pound , if they become a large part of the diet , they can raise the overall calorie density and make it much easier to overeat on calories and easy to gain weight and / or not lose weight , even with a higher activity level . hence the principles of the mwl program is to avoid those foods , or really limit them.in regard to how many calories to eat , that is another number , that … .1 ) has no simple answer unless you plan to maintain the exact same physical activity , exercise , stress , temperature , etc etc every day . the concept that everyone needs a certain calorie level that can be determined is wrong.2 ) i do not think people need to know this number nor do i think there are any great ways to calculate it . all the forumlas have great margins of error in them . so does all estimates of how many calories there are in food . any calorie estimate you see on any food package can be up to 20 % off . formulas can be over 40 % off . professionals trying to track their calorie intake can be 30 % off . why attempt to measure something that we have such poor ways of measuring.3 ) calorie density is a much better approach then counting calories as it uses general guidelines and principles to help make healthier choices.we should focus our diets on a variety of healthy foods within the healthy food groups , get enough activity and physical exercise , and not worry about micromanaging our intake.if we need to lose weight , then we can shift our overall calorie density down by focusing on and including more foods lower in calorie density and limiting the higher calorie dense foods . if we need to gain some weight , then we can do the opposite and include more higher calorie dense healthy foods . of course , we can also adjust activity levels to coincide with our food intake and our goals.to summarize for simplicity for those interested in weight maintenanceeat freely : ( foods low in calorie density ) fruits and veggieseat relatively large portions without concern : ( foods moderate in calorie density ) starchy veggies , intact whole grains and legumeslimit these foods ( foods high in calorie density ) breads , bagels , dry cereals , crackers , tortilla ’ s , dried fruitextremely limit these foods : ( foods very high in calorie density ) nuts , seeds , oils , solid fats , junk foodsthe beauty of calorie density is that it frees us from all these numbers and having to count , portion weigh and / or measure anything . so , don ’ t get caught up in the numbers and for those who do not like numbers , just understand the principle . – hunger & satietywhenever hungry , eat until you are comfortably full . don ’ t starve and don ’ t stuff yourself . – sequence your meals.start all meals with a salad , soup and / or fruit – don ’ t drink your caloriesavoid liquid calories . eat / chew your calories , don ’ t drink or liquify them . liquids have little if any satiety so they do not fill you up as much as solid foods of equal calories . – dilution is the solution : dilute out high calorie dense foods / mealsdilute the calorie density of your meals by filling 1 / 2 your plate ( by visual volume ) with intact whole grains , starchy vegetables and / or legumes and the other half with vegetables and / or fruit . – be aware of the impact of vegetables vs fat / oilvegetables are the lowest in calorie density while fat and oil are the highest . therefore , adding vegetables to any dish will always lower the overall calorie density of a meal while adding fat and oil will always raise the overall calorie density of a meal – limit high calorie dense foodslimit ( or avoid ) foods that are higher in calorie density ( dried fruit , high fat plant foods , processed whole grains , etc ) . if you use them , incorporate them into meals that are made up of low calorie dense foods and think of them as a condiment to the meal . for example , add a few slices of avocado added to a large salad , or a few walnuts or raisins added in a bowl of oatmeal and fruit.hi toxin ! dr greger did not recommand to limit nuts , as you can see in his video ” nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence ” 2 years ago . has this changed ? btw , thank you very much to all of you , dr greger and team , for that so useful work ! now , we better know what to eat or not . brigittethanks for your post.i personally do not think consuming nuts as a significant portion of calories is the most healthful approach . heart disease reversal has only been demonstrated on a low fat plant based diet , not one high in nuts . i think the studies dr. greger shares in the video are valuable , but i question the applicability they have with a slim “ vegan ” who does not consume much fat . when you take anyone eating the standard american diet and give them something healthy , positive benefits will almost always be present.thanks toxins . ok for a low fat , and good fat , intake . but too many is not healthy . so , how much is enough ? i ’ d like to know what the latest recommandations are.and , also , how much is too much- what does the science says about that ? adding an ounce or 2 of nuts is fine . i prefer walnuts and flax , as they are the healthiest . if you are generally consuming a starch based diet with lots of veggies , you shouldn ’ t have any problems.some vegans use a lot of oil , and way too much of the fatty plants ( nuts , nut butters , avocado ) and they will have trouble losing weight . eating whole foods , plant based , no added oil , and keeping nuts and avocado in their proper place as special occasional treats , will result in weight loss for sure . granted there may be fewer calories , but this way of eating requires no portion control or actual calorie counting and hunger is non-existent . dr. john mcdougall outlines a terrific plan for success for both health and weight loss in the starch solution.nutrition dense if we look at 100 gr beef it has more vitamins / minerals then 100 gr of blueberries or green veggies like kale. so you get more nutrition out of beef then veggies or fruit. how can you say then that veggie are more nutrition dense. if beef has more.don ’ t forget the thousands of phytonutrients found in whole plant foods , and the effect of baggage that comes with animal based foods.i think you need to look up the most commonly used definition of nutrient density . grams of a food are not relevant when calculating nutrient density defined as the total nutrient content to total energy content . you should be comparing 100kcal of beef with 100kcal of blueberries or green veggies . i think you will find fruits and vegetables far more nutrient dense.is there any evidence that eating lighter meals in the evening results in weight loss ? i have seen studies that claim that biologically we are meant to be vegans , due to the structure of our teeth , the length of our intestine , as well as the fact that most people are unable to digest diary . is being vegan significantly better for you biologically ? hi chay . you can always post the study on our website for further discussion . dr. greger mentions paleolithic diets ! in this great blog post , if interested.i have been vegan for a few months and i can defiantly agree with the statement that you feel better mentally and physically when you go meat ( and diary ) -free.i am vegan and i obtain the same , if not more calories than meat-eaters . it is just harder to ensure that i get enough protein but that is why i think vegans are healthier , they pay more attention to what they put into their bodies.if looking for additional protein sources let me know ! i ’ ve found many folks who try a vegan diet can get plenty . dr. greger mentions protein

88	why athletes should eat nutritional yeast does powering up at the gym also power up our immune system ? research has shown that moderate exercise improves immunity and decreases illness rates . according to an article in the american journal of lifestyle medicine , “ the most important finding that has emerged from exercise immunology studies during the past two decades is that positive changes in our immune system take place during each bout of moderate physical activity . over time , this translates to fewer days of sickness from , for example , the common cold and other upper respiratory infections . ” the best available evidence suggests a 25 % to 50 % reduction in sick days . name one drug or supplement that can do that ! and it doesn ’ t take much . let kids run around for just six minutes and we can boost the number of immune cells circulating in their blood stream by more than a third . at the other end of the life cycle , exercise may help prevent age-related immune decline . sedentary women in their 70s may have a 50 % chance of getting an upper respiratory illness during the fall season every year . but with just a half-hour walk each day , their risk is down to 20 % . the runners in the group got it under 10 % – five times better ! while regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers upper respiratory infection risk , sustained and intense exertion may have the opposite effect , forming a so-called j-shaped curve relationship ( you can see this curve diagram in my video , preserving immune function in athletes with nutritional yeast ) . as we go from inactive to active , our infection risk declines . but if we overtrain , as hardcore athletes do , we may actually put excessive stress on our body and increase our risk of infection . then we could lose training days , and our performance could suffer . so how can we fight off sickness while continuing to train ? traditional sports medicine doesn ’ t appear to offer much help , advising athletes to basically not pick their nose , avoid sick people , and get a flu shot . but there may be a natural solution . a new study found that we can better maintain our level of circulating white blood cells after exhaustive exercise by consuming a special type of fiber found in baker ’ s , brewer ’ s , and nutritional yeast . ( brewer ’ s yeast is bitter , but nutritional yeast has a nice cheesy flavor . i use it mostly to sprinkle on popcorn ) . normally , two hours after hardcore cycling , there can be a dip in circulating white blood cells , one of our first lines of defense . however , after strenuous exercise , those who ate the equivalent of less than three quarters of a teaspoon a day of nutritional yeast ended up even better than when they started . but does this increase in immune cells translate into fewer illnesses ? researchers studied competitors in the carlsbad marathon to find out . in the weeks following the race , a significant number of runners began experiencing upper respiratory tract infection symptoms while taking a placebo . those runners who were taking the equivalent of a daily spoonful of nutritional yeast cut their rates of infection in half . and they felt better , too . they were asked how they felt on a scale of one to ten . people taking the sugar pills were okay , down around four or five , but those taking identical looking capsules of the fiber found in nutritional yeast were up at six or seven . elite athletes tend to normally experience deterioration in mood state during intense training periods , and before and after a marathon race . sprinkle on a little spoonful of nutritional yeast , though , and you may feel less tense , less fatigued , less confused , even less angry ( and my personal favorite , they had significantly “ increased vigor ” ) . don ’ t have time to exercise ? yes you do ! see standing up for your health . find more on the benefits of exercise in : what else can we do to preserve our immune function ? see : nutritional yeast that ’ s fortified can also be a convenient source of vitamin b12 ( safest source of b12 ) . is there a whole food substance , as in a fruit or vegetable or nut or seed , bean or grain , that we can take instead of the the nutritional yeast in order to achieve this same benefit ? i ’ d rather not have to take some over-the-counter processed and packaged product such as nutritional and brewer ’ s yeast . surely nature has provided us an alternative to nutritional yeast ( other than meat , fish , dairy , egg , etc . ) i hope ? yeast is a food . it ’ s a type of fungi . remember to “ eat outside your kingdom ” . would you consider mushrooms to be a whole food or an over the counter processed and packaged product ? i get kalm yeast ( a probiotic ) in my sauerkraut , just by making it . it ’ s not a processed and packaged product . if you consume bread , beer , or wine , you are also consuming yeast . yeast is natural . people have been accidentally or intentionally consuming it for millions of years . john s pdx orthe yeast you buy at a health food store ( from the biggest , most reputable health food stores , to the smallest mom-and-pop organics ) is grown with synthetic vitamins . not all brands “ fortify ” there nutritional yeast , but all brands that i am aware of ( and i have contacted the biggest , most known companies ) have all admitted that they “ grow ” the yeast with synthetic vitamins . i hope this makes sense . and i do not consider some of these synthetic vitamins to be “ food ” . the yeast on mushrooms … .different story , no synthetic vitamins used to increase the “ naturally occurring vitamins . ” no sense being strictly puritanical about these things . nature doesn ’ t intentionally provide us with anything , because it isn ’ t a conscious , benevolent being . and synthetic does not equal bad . not at all.actually , synthetic folate ( folic acid ) has a real bad track record – dr. g here seems to agree , as well as the other major vegan doctors in the press . eating products that were grown with synthetic folate ( folic acid ) just doesn ’ t seem prudent . very few vegans and others are even aware that the un-fortiifed versions are still grown using synthetic vitamins.but dr. gregor consumes nutritional yeast ( on his popcorn ) , so he doesn ’ t seem to concerned about the synthetic vitamin issue . here is a reputable source on the folic acid issue : http : / / www.health.harvard.edu / newsweek / the-ups-and-downs-of-folic-acid-fortification.htmin the context of a healthy plant based diet , synthetic vitamins from nutritional yeast should not be a concern , in my opinion.i doubt dr. greger was / is even aware that the non-fortified nutritional yeasts are grown with synthetic vitamins ( the fortified versions are both grown with the vitamins as well as added in – -aka fortified – after the growth of the yeast ) . not one single person who consumes nutritional yeast , from the ones i have spoken with , has been aware of this . i never was aware until i asked the companies directly , and i had to have them put it in writing since i feed this to someone who can not have folic acid in any form or amount ( folate from food is fine ) . even the most knowledgable vegans i know had no idea that this was the case . i just think it is a case that no one ever questioned this issue , because the products said “ un-fortified ” , but my intuition said that some of the b vitamins were sky high either way in the non-fortified versions , and i highly doubted nature produced all of these vitamins solely.which companies did you contact ? did you contact patricia bragg ? some b vitamins could be sky high if the yeast were grown on a different medium.would be interested in hearing dr. greger and others weigh in on this , too . while i love nutritional yeast and doubt i ’ d be booting it out of my life entirely , if it does contain synthetic vitamins i ’ d prefer to limit it . it sounds like the amounts that might bring benefits are small , anyway . i can easily eat a cup of the stuff a day ( mixed into creamy , vegan , cheesy sauces , etc . ) , but if it contains synthetic vitamins ( folic acid as opposed to folate , etc . ) maybe this isn ’ t best.strange : my grandmother never exercised except for back bends , and lived to be 96 . my father was a couch potato and lived to be 87 ; my mother never exercised and lived to be 92 . exercise is not the panacea for long life.liars- some people are genetically blessed . you appear to be one of those people . the question is not “ who gets to live a long life ? ” , but how can someone live a longer life ? ” in science , we have to be careful about exactly what questions we are asking . exercise can increase the length of life compared to one ’ s normal life span , which differs in each individual . john s pdx orwhat ’ s more important then how long someone lived is how long someone lived well . our society ( pharmaceutical companies , etc . ) today is keeping people alive longer living miserable lives . my four grandparents lived into their 90s but suffered for many years ( a decade if not longer ) ; in and out of the hospital , in wheelchairs , limited mobility , brain fog , etc . it ’ s been proven time and time again moderate exercise as simple as yoga , tai chi , gardening , walking , swimming that can be done in old age or throughout life can certainly assist in warding off some of these issues.i teach tai chi for strength , posture and balance … … basically to stop older people from falling over . for most people it improves their independence and ability to live a full life . however this is not running or aerobic exercise and my impression is that all exercise is good and doing what you enjoy is good . we also live a more sedentary life and this is associated with a range of dis-ease . is our body here to just carry our brain around ? personally i was happy when my mother took up tai chi because it improved her health and she walked till the day she died , sometimes i ’ ve taught people who smoke and they are oldish but i wouldn ’ t then suggest that this is the way to liveyour grandparents led more active lifestyles and ate healthier growing up . nothing is a panacea for health . it takes a combination of healthy eating , rest , and an adequate level of physical activity . what ’ s strange is how people who don ’ t exercise find excuses to attack it . lazy sh ! ts will be lazy sh ! ts.no but it sure does help with the quality of one ’ s life . better sleep , sex , confidence , body image , skin , circulation , bp , vitality , anxiety , stress , depression , and the list goes on . a long life does not mean a good quality and happy life . my grandfather lived to 94 and my grandmother to 89- can ’ t say they had good quality at the end of it all . something to consider and if moderate exercise is good for us- then yay ! no need to feel we need to kill ourselves to have a benefit.they had very good quality of life w / o exercise . as did my father and mother who lived into lower 90s and up 80s . never ever did any exercise and they were never sick.not good enough for me . i would rather have a great quality of life and that requires exercise . no matter how great your parents quality of life , it could have been even better with exercise.i think that is great but the benefits should not be discounted for others . namaste.great article as usual . i hit the “ like ” button for fb and i don ’ t think anything happened.does any of the listed yeast increase “ negative ” yeast such as candia ? maybe give nutritional yeast the yellow light ? what about the excitotoxin problem of free glutamate or msg in nutritional yeast.another option to crank up these white blood cells other than nutritional yeast ? something raw or natural ? i normally eat my nutritional yeast with breakfast , before i strenuously train . i wonder when the participants in the study consume the nutritional yeast tablets , was it during the period after the race on a daily basis ? was it two hours after the strenuous exercise ? the article refers to a dip in white blood cells 2 hours after strenuous exercise , but does not mention when the nutritional yeast was consumed by the athletes.what about the folic acid added to nutritional yeast ? i am confused . please help me get this right . i thought that multivitamins were a bad idea . the fortified nutritional yeast that i have ( i bought it before i read the ingredients ) has niacin and folic acid added to it ( among others ) . aren ’ t those to be avoided in supplement form ? i was actually planning to purchase non-fortified nutritional yeast next time . does the non-fortified nutritional yeast work the same as the fortified ? or does the fortified yeast help the immune system work because of the added vitamins ? even non-fortified nutritional yeasts are grown using synthetic vitamins . the nutritional yeasts that are fortified have the vitamins added in afterwards . either way , seems like you are getting synthetics if you eat these products.you didn ’ t mention what kind of fiber it is ! do you have any information on the specifics ? can individuals that suffer with chronic migraine ingest nutritional yeast ? i have chronic migraines and use nutritional yeast daily and cocoa powder . just because some people can ’ t tolerate these things doesn ’ t mean that everyone with migraine can ’ t . i haven ’ t found any whole foods plant based non-processed foods that i can ’ t tolerate.it really depends on what ’ s causing your migraines . i ’ ve never heard of people having issues from nutritional yeast . my own migraines were triggered by dairy consumption ; i ’ ve not had a full-blown one since going vegan 4 and a half years ago , and rarely get headaches of any kind now.does this also apply to brewers yeast or only nutritional yeast ? thanks for your time.this article might help understand the difference. http : / / www.milkandhoneyhealthfoods.com / brewers-yeast-versus-nutritional-yeastare “ sugar pills ” really sugar ? because i don ’ t think athletes eat much sugar , and adding sugar every day would probably increase your chances of getting sick , don ’ t you think ? i mean , i feel better when idont eat sugar.how do people get the nutritional yeast to stick to their popcorn ? it all falls to the bottom of the bowl . what am i missing here ? i ’ m trying to reconcile the advice given here with the content of this video dr. greger made.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-folic-acid-be-harmful / it seems that it is possible to get unfortified nutritional yeast , but that most aren ’ t . unfortunately the one i use , bob ’ s red mill , contains added folic acid . according to toxins ( see comments on above video ) , folic acid consumption was shown to be problematic if exceeding 0.4 mg . this is roughly the amount contained in 1 / 4 cup of bob ’ s red mill nutritional yeast , according to their website ( see link below ) . like many other nooch-lovers out there , i regularly exceed that amount , but now i ’ m really rethinking my consumption of this stuff.http : / / blog.bobsredmill.com / recipes / nutritional-yeast-demystified / can you weigh in on this , dr. greger ? thanks ! vote for yeast here : http : / / examine.com / faq / potential / hi dr. greger , i have read regarding the storage of vitamineb12 injections should be kept at a certain range of temperature and away from sunlight . i was wondering if this applies to supplements and / or fortified nutritional yeast ? on the study that you showcased on athletes vs. nutritional yeast ; your article stated that it is due to a specific fiber that helps our immune system . on this study was the nutritional yeast fortified or non-fortified ? if so would the vitamin b12 play a role in the results ? if so couldn ’ t we just take a certain dose of vitamin b12 after excessive exercise and see the same results or equivalent ? on a side note , i understand very well that the supplement business is no way regulated and it ends up being on trust without much evidence that the numbers / label are truly what is in the bottle . as in the case of your latest update regarding red star product ; are there any brands or resources that you would recommend in this ocean filled of brands / manufactures of fortified nutritional yeast , b12 supplements and vitamin d2.for other nutritional yeast fanatics out there here are my top 15 favorite uses for it . thought i would share : ) 1 . popcorn . probably my favorite usage of nutritional yeast . sprinkle nutritional yeast on top of popcorn and i guarantee by the end of the bowl you will be licking it off your fingers : ) 2 . potatoes . add nutritional yeast to your mashed potatoes for added cheesy flavor . sometime i also sprinkle it on baked potatoes and sweet potatoes ( this is a great substitution for butter or sour cream ) .3 . soups / stews . stir in some nutritional yeast as a savory flavor adder.4. kale chips . lightly mist raw kale with oil . sprinkle with mrs. dash & nutritional yeast & bake until crispy . yum ! 5 . pizza . sprinkle nutritional yeast on top of cheese-less pizza.6. spaghetti . ditch the green can of processed parmesan cheese . instead use a few sprinkles of nutritional yeast.7. vegan pesto . substitute nutritional yeast for parmesan cheese in pesto recipes – it ’ s even better than the original cheese-filled version ! 8 . vegan mac & cheese . nutritional yeast can be made into a cheese-less sauce , perfect for vegan version of kid ’ s favorite meal ! there are tons of recipes floating around online.9. vegan nacho cheese dip . sounds weird , but tastes amazing . i have adapted my personal recipe from one that i originally found in “ the everything vegan cookbook ” by jolinda hackett . it combines nutritional yeast , flour , peanut butter , salsa & a few other ingredients and i swear omnivores can ’ t even tell the difference ! 10 . grits . craving good old fashioned sausage & grits ? simply cook some grits , add some gimme lean veggie sausage , a little unsweetened soy milk & vegan butter , + nutritional yeast and you will think you are eating the real thing ! 11 . roasted veggies . sprinkle on top of roasted veggies to add cheesiness.12. bread crumbs . use nutritional yeast in place of bread crumbs ! 13 . salad topper . sprinkle on top of salads to add flavor without all the added fat calories in typical salad dressings.14. vegan gravy . nutritional yeast provides a flavor boost to vegan gravies.15. dog food . yes , dog food . one client told me that her dog would never eat it ’ s food until she started adding nutritional yeast to it and now her dog can ’ t get enough of the stuff ! tara : nice list ! thanks for sharing ! ! i use a lot of the stuff myself . i particularly like it in sauces.how much nutritional yeast is too much ? ? if one consumes more than the recommended dose daily , are there negative effects as a consequence ? me and my friends tend to eat way more of it than the recommended 2 tbsps daily ( we sprinkle it on basically everything ) , and we ’ re concerned that this might be bad for health , but still have not found an evidence online , nor has anyone said how much of it is the limit for good health ! could you please enlighten us ? i don ’ t know what “ sprinkle on a little spoonful ” means . what ’ s a “ little spoonful ” ? a teaspoon ? as opposed to a “ big spoonful , ” aka a tablespoon ? you did mention 3 / 4 teaspoon in one study , but i notice that various brands of nutritional yeast have different serving size suggestions — some as much as a couple of tablespoons . so how much , exactly , should i put in my morning smoothy to keep my immune system revving ? to me that means about 1 teaspoon . a spoonful usually means 1 tablespoon . so i think anywhere from 1tsp – 1 tbsp is fine. aging , children , cognition , common cold , exercise , fatigue , fiber , immune function , mood , nutritional yeast , respiratory infections , stress , yeast - -
92	why the egg-cancer link ? two million men in the u.s. are living with prostate cancer — but that ’ s better than dying from prostate cancer . catch it when it ’ s localized and the five-year survival is practically guaranteed , but once it really starts spreading , chances drop to one in three . “ thus , identification of modifiable factors that affect the progression of prostate cancer is something that deserves study , ” noted dr. erin richman and colleagues at harvard . so , they took more than a thousand men with early stage prostate cancer and followed them for a couple years to see if there was anything in their diet associated with a resurgence of the cancer , such as spreading to the bone . compared to men who hardly ate any eggs , men who ate even less than a single egg a day had a significant 2-fold increased risk of prostate cancer progression . the only thing worse was poultry consumption , with up to four times the risk of progression among high-risk men . they think it might be the cooked meat carcinogens that for some reason build up more in chicken and turkey muscle than in other meats . for more on these so-called heterocyclic amines , see my videos : heterocyclic amines in eggs , cheese , and creatine ? , estrogenic cooked meat carcinogens , and phip : the three strikes breast carcinogen . but what about the eggs ? why would less than once-a-day egg consumption double the risk of cancer progression ? “ a plausible mechanism that may explain the association between eggs and prostate cancer progression is high dietary choline , ” the researchers suggested . egg consumption is a determinant of how much choline you have in your blood , and higher blood choline has been associated with a greater risk of getting prostate cancer in the first place . so the choline in eggs may both increase one ’ s risk of getting it and having it spread . studies have associated choline consumption not just with getting cancer and spreading cancer , but also with significantly increased risk of dying from it . those who ate the most had a 70 % increased risk of lethal prostate cancer . another recent study found that men who consumed two and a half or more eggs per week — that ’ s just like one egg every three days — had an 81 percent increased risk of lethal prostate cancer . maybe that ’ s why meat , milk , and eggs have all been associated with advanced prostate cancer — because of the choline . choline is so concentrated in cancer cells that doctors can follow choline uptake to track the spread of cancer throughout the body . but why may dietary choline increase the risk of lethal prostate cancer ? dietary choline is converted in the gut to trimethylamine ( see my video carnitine , choline , cancer and cholesterol : the tmao connection ) , so the harvard researchers speculated that the tmao from the high dietary choline intake may increase inflammation , which may promote progression of prostate cancer to a lethal disease . in one of my videos , eggs and choline : something fishy , i talked about what trimethylamine might do to one ’ s body odor . in the new england journal of medicine , the same cleveland clinic research team that did the famous study on carnitine repeated the study , but instead of feeding people a steak , they fed people some hard-boiled eggs . just as they suspected , a similar spike in that toxic tmao . so it ’ s not just red meat . and the link between tmao levels in the blood and strokes , heart attacks , and death was seen even in low-risk groups like those with low-risk cholesterol levels . thus , because of the choline , eating eggs may increase our risk regardless of what our cholesterol is . it ’ s ironic that the choline content of eggs is something the egg industry actually boasts about . and the industry is aware of the cancer data . through the freedom of information act , i was able to get my hands on an email ( which you can view in my video , eggs , choline , and cancer ) from the executive director of the industry ’ s egg nutrition center to an american egg board executive talking about how choline may be a culprit in promoting cancer progression . “ certainly worth keeping in mind , ” he said , “ as we continue to promote choline as another good reason to consume eggs . ” with regard to the prevention of prostate cancer progression , chicken and eggs may be the worst foods to eat , but what might be the best ?

, followed up by the pritikin foundation : ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay . flax may help as well ( flaxseed vs. prostate cancer ) . is there a human or dietary need for choline ? sam , yes . this link provides a good summary : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / books / nbk114308 / kwd : thanks for that link.sam : i can provide a little more info on the topic . a good reference book for our nutritional needs is the book , “ becoming vegan , express edition ” by brenda davis and vasanto melina . they did a * ton * of research to write that book , and they have a lot of experience behind them.here is a quote from the book concerning choline : “ choline has hopped back and forth across the line between vitamin – and therefore essential – and nonvitamin . that ’ s because the body can produce sufficient choline unless a person ’ s diet is short on folate , vitamin b12 , and the amino acid methionine . people seem to need significantly different amounts depending on genetics and diet . ” you can learn more about the topic by reading the book itself . i just wanted to share that really interesting bit . i interpreted the above to mean : as long as you are generally healthy and eating a healthy diet , you don ’ t have to worry about choline intake.dr. greger does not appear to be particularly concerned about focusing on choline intake . here are dr. greger ’ s nutritional recommendations . notice the lack of concern about choline for people on a whole plant food based diet : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / fish also contain choline . however reports say if u dont eat fish u double the risks of dementia.maybe that why previously choline has been touted as brain food ! peter smith : i know there are articles out there that say that fish is good for the brain . but the overall science does not seem to support this theory . here is an example report from pcrm : “ fish oil supplements no help to heart or braintwo new studies found that omega-3 supplements , often sold in the form of fish oil , do not improve the health of the brain or heart . after following more than 12,500 type 2 diabetes patients over the age of 50 for an average of 6.2 years , researchers saw no difference in heart health between those taking an omega-3 supplement versus a placebo . diabetes patients are two to four times more likely to suffer from heart disease or a stroke , compared with people without diabetes . another recent meta-analysis came to the same conclusion for people with a history of heart problems . additionally , in a new review looking at omega-3 supplementation for brain health , researchers found no link between omega-3 supplements and the prevention or improvement of dementia . bosch j , gerstein hc , diaz r , et al. n – 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with dysglycemia . n engl j med . published online june 11 , 2012.kwak sm , myung sk , lee yj . efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplements ( eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid ) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease : a meta-analysis of randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trials . arch intern med . published ahead of print , april 9 , 2012.dangour ad , andreeva va , sydenham e , uauy r. omega 3 fatty acids and cognitive health in older people . br j nutr . 2012 ; 107 : s152-s158 . ” also , if you read dr. barnard ’ s book , “ power foods for the brain ” , you can see that he does not recommend eating any fish . ( he explains why . ) i ’ ll also refer you to my reply to sam previously on this page . the becoming vegan book mentions that lots of plant foods are also rich in choline . my take-home message is : there really is no need to eat fish , most especially if you are concerned about your brain.i don ’ t think one should use data about omega-3 supplements to argue a point about eating fish . various studies have shown omega-3 supplements do not “ track ” fish-eating results e.g. as reported in the berkeley wellness letter v30 , issue 13 , july 2014 in summarizing the findings of the recent meta-analysis on fat intake that ’ s caused such a stir , fish-eating but neither omega-3 supplements or plant-provided ala is associated with lower coronary risk . the two studies you cite refer to omega-3 supplements , not fish eating.choline is the precursor to acetylcholine , one of our primary ‘ thinking ’ neurotransmitters . there are many individuals who supplement choline in a variety of forms ( alpha-gpc , citicoline , and phosphatidylcholine ) to increase cognition . acetylcholine deficiency is linked to alzheimer ’ s disease.and choline rich foods increase the risk of crc ( colorectal ) cancer in post menopausal women as shown in this study : http : / / www.fasebj.org / content / 28 / 1 _ supplement / 370.5i ’ m always suspicious of these correlation studies . maybe it ’ s something else in eggs , rather than the choline , that causes prostate cancer.as it turns out , there is : egg yolks contain a lot of arachidonic acid , of which the body rids itself by producing a dangerous enzyme called 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-lox ) , and 5-lox directly stimulates prostate cancer cell proliferation.in addition , arachidonic acid is metabolized by 5-lox to 5-hete , which prostate cancer cells use to escape destruction . see : http : / / www.lef.org / magazine / mag2007 / feb2007 _ cover _ prostate _ 01.htmfortunately , there ’ s an ayurvedic herb — boswellia serrata — which is sold under various trade names , one of which is “ 5-loxin ” — that helps to counteract the dangerous effects of 5-lox . if one has prostate cancer , this particular herb may be worth considering in addition to eliminating egg yolks from one ’ s diet.hello , would anyone be willing to comment on the following article ? http : / / chriskresser.com / choline-and-tmao-eggs-still-dont-cause-heart-diseasealthough i recently stopped a low-carb paleo diet , i do still read information from varying sources , in hopes of having a broader view . but , all this seems to do is confuse me even more.any feedback will be much appreciated.many thanks , jimso does this mean that egg whites are okay and egg yolks are to be avoided ? hello lars , because egg whites are a rich source of animal protein , we should generally avoid it due to the igf-1 increasing effects . please see here for details. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / protein-intake-and-igf-1-production / what about organically raised free-range real chickens , not the prisoners of mass chicken producers ? most organic / free range operations use the same breeds , which have been bred to grossly overproduce eggs . “ real ” hens live in the jungle and produce about 15 eggs a year . and i don ’ t know if any of this affects choline amounts.the study sited here ( “ choline intake and risk of lethal prostate cancer : incidence and survival ” ) does not explicitly say how the men with the “ highest quintile of choline intake ” obtained their choline , although it strongly implies that they got it strictly by eating “ meat , milk , and eggs ” . to say that choline is the reason for their being in the ‘ highest quintile ’ requires a study involving supplemental choline intake alone , rather than getting choline from meat , milk and eggs , which contain a lot more than just choline.for me , it won ’ t make any difference . i intend to continue taking supplemental choline as it is the only nootropic substance i take that noticeably improves my memory . if doing so increases the risk of prostate cancer , the thing to do is to also supplement with vitamin d3 and saw palmetto and other substances that decrease the risk of prostate cancer . in any case , going around in a choline-deficient stupor for the rest of my life is definitely worse than shortening it by a few years via prostate cancer . american egg board , cancer , cancer survival , carcinogens , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , carnitine , chicken , cholesterol , choline , cleveland clinic , dairy , eggs , freedom of information act , harvard , heart disease , heart health , heterocyclic amines , industry influence , inflammation , lecithin , meat , men 's health , metastases , milk , mortality , poultry , prostate cancer , prostate health , red meat , steak , stroke , supplements , tmao , trimethylamine , turkey - -
93	how eggs can impact body odor i previously lampooned the egg industry pr campaign that tried to promote eggs as a source of eyesight-saving nutrients such as lutein , by noting that a single spoonful of spinach had as much as nine eggs ( see egg industry blind spot ) . the reason we ’ ll only hear that egg industry claim on websites and tv shows , and never in an ad or on an egg carton , is because there are laws against false and misleading advertising that don ’ t allow the industry to say eggs contain lutein because there ’ s such an insignificant amount . in an email i retrieved through the freedom of information act ( you can see the email in my video eggs and choline : something fishy ) , the head of the usda ’ s poultry research and promotion programs reminded the egg industry that they can ’ t mention lutein in an egg ad . they can ’ t say it helps people with macular degeneration , and can ’ t even talk about how good lutein is for us since “ eggs have such a wee amount , and given eggs ’ fat and cholesterol content this is a nonstarter for anything but pr . ” so for public relations , companies can lie through your teeth , but there are laws covering truthfulness in ads . the industry can ’ t say eggs are a source of omega 3s , iron , or folate either . they can ’ t even honestly call eggs a rich source of protein . the usda agriculture marketing service suggested that the egg industry instead boast about the choline content of eggs , one of only two nutrients that eggs are actually rich in , besides cholesterol . so the egg industry switched gears . a priority objective of the american egg board became “ to make choline out to be an urgent problem and eggs the solution . ” they outlined how they could partner with a physician ’ s group and write an “ advertorial . ” they developed a number of them for nutrition journals . an advertorial is an advertisement parading as an objective editorial . they sent letters out to doctors arguing that “ inadequate intake of choline has tremendous public health implications . ” so forget about the cholesterol — the “ elephant-in-the-room , ” as the industry calls it — and focus on this conjured epidemic of choline deficiency . people actually get about twice the choline they need and , in fact , too much choline can be the real problem . for one thing , too much choline can give breath , urine , sweat , saliva , and vaginal secretions an odor resembling rotten fish . millions of americans have a genetic defect that causes a fishy body odor and might benefit from a low-choline diet , since choline is converted in our gut into the fishy compound trimethylamine ( tma ) . individuals oozing trimethylamine often become vegans because reducing the ingestion of dietary animal products rich in lipids decreases tma production and the associated noxious odor . the other 99 percent of us , though , can turn the fishy choline compound into trimethylamine oxide , which is 100 times less stinky . we used to think extra choline was harmless for the 99 percent , but not anymore . researchers at the cleveland clinic found that dietary choline ( after it is converted in our gut to trimethylamine and oxidized in our liver to form trimethylamine oxide ) may contribute to plaque build-up in people ’ s arteries . this may set us up for heart disease , stroke , and death . which foods is choline predominantly found in ? eggs , milk , liver , red meat , poultry and fish . the good news is that this may mean a new approach to prevent or treat heart disease , the most obvious of which would be to limit dietary choline intake . but if that means decreasing egg , meat and dairy consumption , then the new approach sounds an awful lot like the old approach – adopting a plant-based diet . choline may be one of the reasons people following the atkins diet are at increased risk of heart disease whereas a more plant-based diet like ornish ’ s can instead reverse our number one killer ( see low carb diets and coronary blood flow ) . this new research adds choline to the list of dietary culprits with the potential to increase the risk of heart disease , making eggs a double whammy — the most concentrated common source of both choline and cholesterol . i previously did a more in depth dive into the choline issue in carnitine , choline , cancer and cholesterol : the tmao connection . more on eggs and cholesterol in egg cholesterol in the diet and avoiding cholesterol is a no brainer . more freedom of information act finds in eggs and cholesterol : patently false and misleading claims , eggs vs. cigarettes in atherosclerosis , and probably my favorite , who says eggs aren ’ t healthy or safe ? what else might make one smell fishy ? see bacterial vaginosis and diet . hello , if the egg industry can ’ t say eggs are a source of omega 3s , why does organic valley state on their eggs that they are a good source of omega 3 ’ s ? thank you.according to the usda , one large conventional egg contains about 50 mg total long and short chain omega 3s . since that is less than 10 % of the adequate intake level for omega 3s , it can ’ t be labelled as a “ good ” source . ( “ good source ” = 10 % of rdi ; “ excellent source ” = 20 % rdi ) however , omega 3s are a a big marketing term these days , and many farmers are supplementing their hens ’ feed to capitalize on this . if an egg farmer uses feed that has been supplemented with omega-3s ( e.g. flaxseed , fish meal , algae ) then increased amounts of omega-3s will naturally be found in the animal ’ s excretions as well . if supplementation increases omega 3 content to 10 % of the recommended intake or greater , they can be called a good source.according to various sources , it ’ s typically stated that hens allowed to forage for grasses , clover , etc , in addition to commercial feed can lay eggs with up to about 2.5 x the omega 3 content as conventional eggs . 2.5 x 50 mg would put you at 125 mg which is between 10 % of the adequate intake for adult females and males ( 1.1 and 1.6 g per day , respectively ) , so these could also legally be deemed a “ good ” source.i would imagine that the rulings and restrictions on descriptions used in advertising are based on conventional eggs . however if individual brands / varieties of of pastured or supplemented eggs are tested and found to have at least 10 % of the recommended intake for omega 3s , then they can legally be called a “ good source ” . legally , this would be similar to selling an enriched box of rice crispies as a “ good source ” of several vitamins ; it doesn ’ t matter where the nutrients came from , if they ’ re in the final product then they can be marketed as such.according to the organic valley website , the hens are fed a “ vegetarian organic diet rich in flax seed ” .i used to eat 2 dozen eggs a week , gave it all up cold turkey – can ’ t stand them anymore . unbelieveable how ignorant the public is about nutrition , we need no animal products in our diet and are far better off without it , our environment is better off without it , it is good for our bank account because it saves so much and is whole plant foods are delicious and what we were designed by natural selection to eat , problem is so many people are addicted to bad foods , particularly dairy and meat , it is so easy to change with so many benefits but most people will ever know – sad . thanks again michael gregor.same here . raised on eggs , milk and meat . sick all over since 4months old through my childhood and teenage years . gaining more fat with each pregnancy . tired of being sick and tired i went vegan at the age 30 . now .. 8 years later i look & feel better than ever . my 5 children are never sick unless they jump into some junk food at their dads house . they are learning from their own mistakes in such early age . but all i can do is to feed them what i eat while they are with me and to be good example . dr.michael your great information is our best support in our vegan life . thank you from all my heart ! i ’ m a plant-based devotee , but i ’ m still interested to know , does choline predominate in the yolk or the white or both . a lot of people separate out the yolk ? jack lalanne advocated “ hard-boiled egg whites . ” it ’ s mostly in the yolk : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / dairy-and-egg-products / 113 / 2 the white has very little : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / dairy-and-egg-products / 112 / 2thanks for the links , big difference i see.a lot of vitamin supplements have choline in them.hi , i have a question regarding iron absorption from plant sources and i would appreciate your answer a lot . how much of the iron present in plants is actually absorbed and can be biologically functional in our bodies ? what does the science say about it ? are iron deficiencies / anemia truly more common among vegetarians / vegans ? i did some of my own research , but the information out there is pretty confusing to me . i have been vegetarian for 6 years and vegan for 2 years and my iron status is fine , but recently a doctor lectured me how dangerously low the absorption of non-heme iron is and honestly speaking i didn ’ t have any scientific arguments to prove him wrong . could you provide me with some reliable knowledge on the subject ? also , i would like to know what are the consequences of consuming too much animal dervied heme-iron and if there are any studies showing that maybe people eating lots of animal products actually provide too much iron for themselvs ? thank you in advance for your time and consideration , best regards , dariathere ’ s a lot on this web site about iron and diet . the bottom line is that a balanced vegan diet is abundant in iron and satisfies most people ’ s needs with no problem . if you have iron-deficiency anemia , you might need to supplement your diet , but you need to be careful as you do it.dr. greger has a good video on the topic at : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-iron-pills-good-for-you / . there ’ s a good discussion following that video.heme iron , which you get in meat , is difficult for the body to control or “ down regulate ” . it may contribute in large part to the problems mentioned in the video . american egg board , animal fat , animal products , animal protein , atkins diet , bad breath , body odor , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , cholesterol , choline , cleveland clinic , dairy , dr. dean ornish , eggs , eye disease , eye health , fat , fish , folate , freedom of information act , gut flora , halitosis , heart disease , heart health , industry influence , iron , lutein , macular degeneration , meat , milk , mortality , omega-3 fatty acids , oral health , plant-based diets , poultry , protein , red meat , saliva , saturated fat , seafood , stroke , surgery , trimethylamine , turkey , usda , vaginal discharge , vaginal health , vegans , vegetarians - -
94	how to design a misleading study imagine working for the now defunct twinkie division of hostess and wanting to take the tobacco industry tact of not just downplaying the risk of your product , but actually promoting it as healthy . how would we do that ? our first problem is that each twinkie has 2.5 grams of saturated fat , which raises cholesterol , the # 1 risk factor of our # 1 killer , heart disease . how are we going to get around that ? well , what if we designed a study in which we took a bunch of people eating our arch-rival , little debbie cloud cakes . now they only have one gram each , so what if we took a group eating five cloud cakes a day — five grams of saturated fat — and then cut that saturated fat intake in half by switching them to eating one twinkie a day . what would happen to their cholesterol levels ? their cholesterol would go down due to their decreased saturated fat consumption . so even though they went from eating five cakes down to one , technically , they went from zero twinkies a day to one twinkie a day , and their cholesterol went down ( we wouldn ’ t mention the five to one thing ) . we publish it and crank out a press release , “ new research shows that eating a twinkie a day can be good for heart health by improving cholesterol levels . ” the media takes our press release and runs with it : “ consumers can eat a twinkie every day if they choose , and feel confident that science supports twinkies ’ healthy benefits , which now include cholesterol-lowering effects ! ” twinkies , we just proved with science , have cholesterol-lowering effects . too outlandish a scenario ? amazingly , that ’ s exactly what the beef industry did ( those above quotes are actual quotes – just replace the word beef for twinkie ) . in a study bought and paid for by the beef industry , beef was added to people ’ s diets . at the same time , the subjects removed so much poultry , pork , fish , and cheese from their diet that they halved their saturated fat intake from 12 percent of their diet , down to 6 percent of their diet , causing their cholesterol levels to go down . if our diet goes from 12 percent saturated fat down to 6 percent saturated fat , it doesn ’ t matter if that 6 percent comes from beef , chicken , lard , or twinkies . if we cut our total saturated fat in half , our cholesterol will follow , especially if we eat more fiber and vegetable protein as they did in the study . the researchers conclude : “ the results of the bold study [ standing for beef in an optimal lean diet ] provide convincing evidence that lean beef can be included in a heart-healthy diet that meets current dietary recommendations and reduces cardiovascular disease risk . ” crisco could be included . krispy crème could be included , as long as we cut our total saturated fat intake . what the researchers fail to mention is that our risk would drop even lower if we dropped the beef , as was pointed out by the chair of nutrition at harvard in a response to the study . the subjects in this study went from a high risk of dying from heart disease to … a high risk of dying from heart disease . we need to get our ldl ( bad ) cholesterol down to 50 , 60 , or 70 to become essentially heart attack proof ( see eliminating the # 1 cause of death ) . for most people , that means eliminating saturated animal fat and cholesterol intake completely . this study is really just showing how bad saturated fat is from any animal source . yes , based on saturated fat levels , lean beef is often better than chicken ( and twinkies ) , but that ’ s like touting the health benefits of coca cola because it has less sugar than pepsi . it does — 15 spoonfuls of sugar per bottle instead of 16 — but that doesn ’ t mean we wouldn ’ t be better not consuming soda at all . reminds me of this study : “ cheese intake lowers ldl-cholesterol compared with butter intake … . ” [ emphasis added ] in my video , bold indeed : beef lowers cholesterol ? you can see the beef industry ’ s release. and how they ended up with the “ cholesterol-lowering effects of beef . ” if we cut out enough poultry , pork , fish , and cheese from our diet , we could replace this with almost anything ( bacon grease , candy , frosting , deep-fried snickers bars , sewer sludge , etc . ) , and still reduce cholesterol levels . how are americans exposed to saturated fat ? burgers actually fall well below chicken . see trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero . the beef industry is by no means alone in having a corrupting influence on the scientific method . see , for example : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16644106please review this veritable study regarding harmful effects of eating sprouted grains . do you feel their is validity in this ? maybe un-sprouted grains are actually safer , as far as this study goes ? dr. greger , correct me if i ’ m wrong but it appears most of our fruits and veggie are adequate in the form of vitamin e called tocopherols , and lacking in the tocotrienols form of vitamin e , and it is these tooctrienols that interest me ( and others ) . now , i ’ d rather not have to ingest red palm oil , but it does this seems to be the only plant-based source that is high in tocotrienols . any thoughts on this vitamin e issue , or low fat sources of tocotrienls other than red palm ? sunflower seeds are the highest source of vitamin e as far as i know.this should be presented in all the schools on the same day they introduce the scientific method . if you would allow … ” greger ’ s postulate # 1 . the twin forces of politics and greed act equal and opposite to the force of logic and reason . ” clever but nice try beef industry , ,the word “ tact ” in the first paragraph should be “ tack . ” “ tack ” is the direction of a boat , and “ tact ” is not a shortened form of “ tactic . ” tact is good manners , reserve.i ’ d really appreciate your take on this study : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3917888 / and what exactly is going on with it . “ potential limitations of our results are due to the fact that the survey was based on cross-sectional data . therefore , no statements can be made whether the poorer health in vegetarians in our study is caused by their dietary habit or if they consume this form of diet due to their poorer health status . ” this study was bogus . first , they grouped vegans and all other kinds of vegetarians together . then , they didn ’ t even go into detail about dietary habits ; “ another limitation concerns the lack of detailed information regarding nutritional components ( e.g. the amount of carbohydrates , cholesterol , or fatty acids consumed ) . ” “ unfortunately , food intake was not measured in more detail , e.g. caloric intake was not covered . ” further , “ we admit that the large number of participants made it necessary to keep the questions simple , in order to cover the large sample . ” this study was a broad and general look into what people say is going on concerning their nutrition , and i would suggest that vegetarians are more health-conscious and likely to notice their health problems more acutely than meat eaters who say things like “ i think i eat healthy ” and “ i have no medical problems ” despite taking pain relievers , excessive caffeine , and other behaviors deemed “ normal ” and / or “ healthy ” by the rest of society.hope that helps.dr. greger loves cherry-picking and any study that goes contrary to his vegetarian diet is non-existent . he is simply vegetarian biased and nothing will dissuade him from following his path , for instance your indicated link does not exist for him or if it does , he will claim that the study in order to be valid must be repeated ad nauseam.jack norris covered this nicely http : / / jacknorrisrd.com / austrian-vegetarian-study-making-waves / where can i find the references , sources for this article ? don ’ t see them . thanks.guest : articles are a little different than the videos . when dr. greger introduces a new study in an article , he usually links to it . but if he is talking about subject matter that he covered in previous videos , then the article links to the video and you have to go to the video to get to the references . just look under the video for the link , “ sources cited ” and then expand that section. animal fat , animal products , bacon , beef , butter , cake , candy , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cheese , chicken , cholesterol , coca cola , crisco , fat , fiber , fish , harvard , heart disease , heart health , industry influence , ldl cholesterol , meat , pepsi , plant protein , pork , poultry , protein , saturated fat , seafood , smoking , soda , sugar , tobacco , turkey , twinkies , vegetable protein - -
95	how grapefruit affects prescription drugs does grapefruit in particular help people lose weight ? if someone eats half of a grapefruit three times a day before each meal for a couple months , they may lose about two pounds — but that ’ s no more than if they ate three apples or pears a day . in one study , the grapefruit eaters not only saw their weight go down , but their waist got slimmer , and their body fat melted away . if , however , we repeat the experiment and instead ask people to drink a half cup of water before each meal , we get the same result . so this belief that grapefruit has some special fat-burning quality appears to be just a long-held myth . the researchers reported that grapefruit consumers had a drop in weight , a significant drop in cholesterol , and a significant drop in blood pressure . they concluded that consumption of grapefruit daily for six weeks does not significantly decrease body weight , cholesterol , or blood pressure , though . that made me do a little double take , but again , it ’ s because the grapefruit didn ’ t do any better than placebo . other studies have found a legitimate cholesterol-lowering benefit of grapefruit , and even a little dip in triglycerides , especially eating red as opposed to white . for example , one study showed a decrease in cholesterol , but only from one life-threatening cholesterol level to another life-threatening cholesterol level . to prevent heart disease , we really have to get down to a total cholesterol of around 150 , which is the average cholesterol of those eating diets composed exclusively of plant foods , not just grapefruits ( see , for example , one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic ) . even though grapefruits alone don ’ t do much , the researchers suggest that people might be more likely to stick with them than cholesterol lowering drugs , noting that most people with heart disease stop taking their statin drugs within a couple years because of the adverse side effects ( see statin muscle toxicity ) . while grapefruits alone don ’ t have any side effects , ironically , combining grapefruits and drugs can make drug side effects even worse . if we eat lots of fruits and vegetables , we hopefully won ’ t need a lot of drugs ( say no to drugs by saying yes to more plants ) , but certain phytochemicals in plants can affect the metabolism of drugs in the body . grapefruit is the poster child , described as a “ pharmacologist ’ s nightmare . ” natural phytochemicals in grapefruit suppress the enzymes that help clear more than half of commonly prescribed drugs , and less drug clearance means higher drug levels in the body . this may actually be good if we want a better caffeine buzz from our morning coffee , or our doctors want to help us save thousands of dollars by boosting the effects of expensive drugs instead of just peeing them away . but higher drug levels may mean higher risk of side effects . women taking the pill are normally at a higher risk of blood clots , but even more so , perhaps , if they have been consuming grapefruit . taking the pill with grapefruit juice may increase blood drug concentrations by 137 percent . if suppressing our drug clearance enzymes with grapefruit juice elevates levels of ingested estrogen , what might it be doing to our own estrogen levels ? a study associating grapefruit consumption with breast cancer freaked out the medical community , but subsequent studies on even larger groups of women found no evidence of a link . the harvard nurses ’ study even found a decreased risk of the scariest breast cancer type , so it doesn ’ t look like we have to worry about grapefruit affecting our natural chemistry . for those prescribed unnatural chemistries , it may be a good idea to discontinue grapefruit consumption for 72 hours before use of a drug that may interact with it . if you don ’ t want to give up your grapefruit , you can ask your doctor about switching from a grapefruit-affected drug like lipitor to one of the citrus-proof alternatives ( the replacement drug chart can be seen in my video , tell your doctor if you eat grapefruit ) . other videos on citrus include : and another video on the risks associated with taking estrogens : plant-based bioidentical hormones . can ’ t eat grapefruit without sprinkling sugar on top ? try erythritol instead to avoid so many empty calories : erythritol may be a sweet antioxidant . are there any other fruits that have this reduced drug clearance effect ? could this be the reason why so many people who go raw vegan end up developing intolerance to caffeine – in even the smallest amounts ? “ … grapefruits alone don ’ t have any side effects … ” except for canker sores.please consider the fact that the majority of the desired phytochemical compounds in any discussion of plant-based healing and body-tweeking , are typically found in the skin , the layer just under the skin , and the seeds of ( for example ) citrus , peppers , berries , pomegranates , apples , apricots / peaches , etc . this means there has to be a difference in bio-availability ( and cost-effectiveness ! ) of whole food machine preparation made possible with a vita-mixer , bullet , or high-powered blender type machine . this needs to be pointed out and noticed by everyone no matter which stage you are committed to – ; the cancer prevention , cancer suppression , or the cancer cell apoptosis diet . for someone like me , in month 9 of my “ alternative cancer treatment ” ( protocol # 4 ) of a what is looking like a full calendar year of successfully treating multiple cancers in my body. these details matter due to cost alone . i have accomplished this on an extremely small monthly subsistence income ( social security ) , and had zero room for error , waste , or lost opportunity for maximizing benefits whereever feasible . after 4 months of no / extremely low carbs ( no grains or sugars from any source ) , i have been able to add in a daily medicine dessert salad comprised of : 1-2 pink grapefruit cut up , 2-4 thumbs grated / sliced fresh ginger root , 1 / 2 cup packed minced cilantro . this anti-parasite , heavy metal detox , cancer cell apoptosis-inducing plateful of deliciousness is only possible if you are not taking any pharmaceuticals , because whatever causes grapefruit to interact with drug clearing in our body is magnified many times when you turn these 3 phytochemicals into a synergistic medicine dish . oh , and don ’ t forget to knife off just the barest of the outer flesh , leaving the most “ white ” possible on the grapefruit – this is giving yourself the highest amounts of hesperin and the other medicine components we want more of everyday . the other method is to take the partially peeled citrus fruit and throw into a blender type machine which will trichurate the bioflavinoids , rutin , hesperin , etc . , found in the edible skin and seeds … .this is cost-effective , whole food / plant-based alternative chemotherapy.what is the theory behind low carbs for four months ? the # 1 required food energy source for cancer cells to survive , multiply and grow is sugar ; it does not matter the source – fructose , starch , honey , processed hfcs . sugar feeds cancer cells . this fact is agreed upon by conventional oncologists as well as alternative oncologists . the standard anti-cancer diet is removing their fuel source ( sugar ) and when the cancer cells are down , you hit them with the correct known cancer cell killing plant medicines and strategic supplements known to support the action of these cancer cell destroying herbs , roots , mushrooms , barks , flowers ( my daily regimen involves up to 14 different ones ) . cancer cells can also derive fuel from high-protein animal foods , but it takes much more effort and time for them to convert from this food source ; nevertheless , i did remove all animal also . gluten is involved also in terms of efficiency of your plant medicine diet , even is you are not officially gluten-intolerant . alkalinizing your body ( recognized by outcome not ingoing – lemons for example are acid but produce alkaline reaction ) will happen automatically if you have switched to only consuming the correct foods ( mostly certain vegetables ) , are sufficiently hydrated , have sufficient volume ( bulk , fiber ) going through your system , are resupplying your gut with the broadest spectrum probiotics , and at some point ( mine was protocol # 3 ) , you need to address the removal of heavy metals and parasites – this phase of my treatment was / is the most interesting and resulted in the most qol improvements . the no carb first few months led to the ability to introduce small amounts of carbs without symptoms returning – once / month i tested with a homemade dessert to prove to myself what i was reading . cancer cells love sugar and the sensation is similar to relapsing when trying to withdraw from a drug addiction . in fact , many studies show the exact center of the brain is activated in sugar addiction as with drug and alcohol addiction . i will be watching my carbohydrate consumption for the rest of my life and use the sugar craving as my gauge for whether or not i am feeding cancer cells too much – it is now known we are all born with damaged dna / cancer capable cells in our bodies ; they will morph into cancerous cells if the conditions are correct – exposures to carcinogens , malnutritiion , etc . i intend to starve the cancer cells in my body for the rest of my life by not giving them their favorite food.has this method been studied , tested by scientists / researchers ? interesting stuff you ’ ve written , curious how it holds up to medical review . maybe dr. greger can offer his knowledge of such matters . thanks.leslie : self-designed , self-administered alternative cancer treatment is not for everyone . one must first and foremost have a compelling reason for avoiding standard treatments and it needs to be more than political , i.e. a desire to avoid supporting the “ cancer industry . ” you need to screen yourself for the following : highly developed self-awareness of one ’ s cognitive bias ( which inc understanding of the cancer industry messaging that goes on all around us from our medical service providers to the media to well-meaning friends and family – most people have lost their ability for independent thought and most importantly , have dulled or non-existent self-biofeedback ability ( being able to accurately read body trouble lights and to know what to do ) … .the other thing is you need to have a highly developed research capability and even though i think we have entered the last days of the internet as we know it , an astute mind can discern correctly and construct a cancer self-treatment which rivals what will cost you tens of thousands of dollars to purchase at the best alternative cancer treatment centers in the world . paying yourself to do this then becomes the practice for prevention of future problems , as well as the only economic means of accomplishing what you will never be able to afford out-of-pocket unless you are the 1 % or have a rich daddy , property to liquidate , or inheritance to forfeit ( my highly customized program , which has been shown by conventional medicine to be working , costs a tiny fraction of what it would have cost at the best-in-group alternative cancer treatment program i could find . what i have done is to prove is that if i can do this on a ss check , living in a barn , having other co-existent medicals dragging me down ( tbi / dementia , lifelong immune damage from experimental prescriptions , kidney / liver failure ) – then anyone can do this . but you must first believe in your ability , must be ready to let go of the spin messages around cancer and you need to reach out and create supportive coaches and teachers and cohorts whereever possible . again , so long as the internet exists for us it is the lifeline.wondering if you feel that a high fruit diet could actually cause cancer ? dear ariel , i am trying to do what you are trying to do , and really enjoy reading your posts . you are inspirational.hi eileen : why don ’ t you contact me offsite at my regular email address – there are literally thousands of us in na alone , doing this . we need to increase our interaction and information sharing . my regular email address is my name at yahoo , without the caps or spaces : ariel gail macleani , m vegan and not at all intolerant to coffeine .. : ) i read an article that stated that just the smell of grapefruit can cause a person to suppress their appetite . could it be that grapefruit may cause weight loss due to this rather than the effect it may have on the metabolism ? i am not sure by just smelling grapefruit it would have that effect . feel free to post the article if you stumble across.people eat grapefruit differently , i know some who add sugar to their grapefruit . the study was not specific in that regard.good point ! sugar on grapefruit ( the way my grandmother made it for me when i was younger ) is not the best idea . in the study dr. greger references i don ’ t think they told participants to use sugar.surely the grapefruit accounts for something ? were the subjects given the same food for the rest of the day ? and do all of them have healthy metabolisms ? and exercise ? hi johan . the articles can be found within the links . researchers usually try to control for factors like exercise and diet . i think grapefruit is a fine fruit to consume and like others it provides an abundance of phytonutrients and vitamins , but the idea of this blog is that 1 ) it ’ s not a miracle weight loss fruit , and 2 ) those taking prescription medication need to be cautious. abdominal fat , apples , beverages , birth control pills , blood clots , blood pressure , body fat , breast cancer , breast health , caffeine , cancer , cardiac disease , cardiac health , cholesterol , citrus , cost savings , fat , flexitarians , fruit , grapefruit , grapefruit juice , harvard nurses ' health study , heart disease , heart health , hypertension , ldl cholesterol , lipitor , lovastatin , medications , mortality , nutrition myths , obesity , pears , placebo , plant-based diets , side effects , statins , triglycerides , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , water , weight loss , women 's health - -
97	test to see if your diet is alkaline or acid forming in my video alkaline diets , animal protein , and calcium loss i presented evidence challenging the notion that our body is buffering the acid formed from our diet with calcium from our bones . how then is our body neutralizing the acid ? maybe with our muscles ! our blood gets more acidic as we age and our kidney function declines , and this may be a reason we lose muscle mass as we get older . as a pair of researchers note : “ the modern western diet based on animal products generates an acid load that may cause a lifespan state of unnoticed and growing metabolic acidosis . ” this chronic low-level diet-dependent metabolic acidosis might contribute to the progressive shrinking of our muscle mass as we age . muscle wasting appears to be an adaptive response to acidosis . when our muscles break down , amino acids are released into the bloodstream . our liver can then take these amino acids and make something called glutamine , which our kidneys can use to get rid of excess acid . and indeed , in a three year study i profile in my video , testing your diet with pee and purple cabbage , those over age 65 eating alkaline diets were better able to preserve their muscle mass , which the researchers think may be because the alkaline-producing fruits and vegetables helped relieve the mild acidosis that occurs with the ingestion of the standard american diet . so what should we think about the latest review ’ s question , “ does an alkaline diet benefit health ? ” if the question is “ does a diet low in meat , eggs , and dairy — all acid-producing — and high in fruits and vegetables with lots of dark green leafies benefit health ? ” then of course the answer is yes , an alkaline diet benefits health . but if the question is “ does it matter what our ‘ peeh ’ is ( whether our urine is acid or alkaline ) regardless of what actually goes into our mouth ? ” then the answer is … still yes , but the accepted benefits of having alkaline urine appear limited to two areas : lower risk of kidney stones and better uric acid clearance . we ’ ve known about kidney stones and alkalinity for a while , but the uric acid data is new . researchers have found that alkalization of the urine is effective for removing uric acid from the body . if you remember from my video flesh and fructose , uric acid is bad stuff ( potentially increasing one ’ s risk of fatal stroke , heart disease , and death ) , so clearing more from your system is a good thing . those eating plant-based diets appear then to have an advantage in this regard . the average vegetarian diet is alkaline producing , and the average meat-eating diet is acid producing . even though there are some acid-forming meat-substitutes , like some of the quorn products , they ’ re not as bad as something like tuna , and they ’ re typically consumed in smaller quantities than meat consumers consume meat . since the protein in plants is usually accompanied by much more potassium ( which is alkalinizing ) , there is good reason to try to meet protein needs from plant sources . and when researchers actually measure urine ph , those eating strictly plant-based diets have the greatest advantage , with significantly more alkaline urine than omnivores . how can we tell what our urine ph is ? well we can be all boring and order some ph paper strips to pee on . or … we can use what everyone should have right now in their crisper , a purple cabbage . everyone should have a red or purple cabbage in their fridge since it is not only one of the single best nutrition bangs for our buck , but we can also do science with it ! first , either boil some purple cabbage until the water turns deep purple or ( a quicker and safer way since there ’ s no hot liquids ) blend some raw with water in a blender and strain out the solids . then what you can do with that royal purple liquid is pour it in the toilet bowl after you urinate . ( you can imagine how much fun kids have with this ! ) if it stays purple , your urine is acidic and you should eat more dark green leafy vegetables . if the toilet bowl turns pink , your urine is really acidic , so you should definitely eat more dark green leafy vegetables . we ’ re looking for blue . if it turns blue that means your urine is neutral or even basic . if it ’ s sky blue , you should … continue to eat more dark green leafy vegetables . now i have a low-flow toilet , so there ’ s very little water in the bowel to start with . the effect might not be as dramatic if diluted in a larger quantity of water . for a step-by-step tutorial , see my video testing your diet with pee & purple cabbage . more bathroom chemistry can be found in pretty in pee-nk and asparagus pee . how else can we protect our muscles ? we can eat healthy enough to avoid statin drugs ( see statin muscle toxicity ) and the neurotoxins that can cause movement disorders ( muscle tremors & diet ) . cherries may also help lower uric acid levels : gout treatment with a cherry on top . superfood bargains is the video in which purple cabbage takes the gold , though it was unseated in biggest nutrition bang for your buck . why do i always go on and on about dark green leafy vegetables ? check out my 58 videos on greens and find out ! : ) my friend , a 65 yr. old women with diabetes , has been eating a mostly a plant based diet for about a year now . she recently had a first-time toe swelling that her doctor diagnosed as gout . she is on metformin which she rarely takes and rarely takes her bp , thyroid , and lithium medicines also . do you have any suggestions to help her avoid gout flare-ups in the future ? ( i suspect she may have eaten a couple of vegetarian meals with milk in the sauce before the flare-up ) .bing cherries – you can buy them frozen year round . eat 45 every day.thanks daniel , i gave her cherries to eat . i was hoping there were other things we could do to her diet to prevent any further flare-ups.my father has horrendous diabetes . he had a horrible case of gout . i went over his house armed with a bottle of cranberry pills . when i was facing a chronic kidney infection and was no longer responding to antibiotics , i began to take extremely high doses of cranberry pills ( 5-6 pills , 3x a day until the symptoms were gone – about 2 weeks and then 2-3 a day for about another 2 weeks and then 1 a day for about a month . ) this was the only action that worked and i haven ’ t had a problem since . so i told my father what worked for me and he copied the approach . the results ? an almost immediate reduction in gout and he ’ s since kept it at bay . perhaps something like this can work for your friend ? i have found that patients following the correct diet will often be able to get off their medications for type two diabetes and high blood pressure . it appears that weight loss and a low fat diet seems to be the best approach for type two diabetes . you can be a “ fat vegan ” however . john mcdougall has written newsletter articles on these conditions that you might find of interest . these articles are all available for free on his website . they are : gout june 2006 , fat vegan december 2008 , simple care for diabetes december 2009 , and how i treat patients with elevated bp november 2009 . i also am a proponent of minimizing psychiatric medications especially after reading robert whitaker ’ s anatomy of an epidemic and peter breggin ’ s book on psychiatric drug withdrawal . it is important to work with your physician ( s ) in adjusting your medications . i would caution against not taking the thyroid medication . we sometimes find that patients have to adjust thyroid medication when they go on a plant based diet . good luck.a hilarious typo here : “ now i have a low-flow toilet , so there ’ s very little water in the bowel to start with . ” thanks , as always , for your insights . so are you saying that the folks claiming that alkaline diets fight cancer are confusing association with cause ? with broccoli sprouts being so packed full of antioxidants – are they an acceptable choice as a green leafy or is that a totally separate animal for different benefits ? this may explain partly why acid producing stress shortens lifespan . also i will continue to drink very acidic pomegranate juice because of my long and close family history of alzheimer ’ s.although pomegranate juice is acidic by itself , it is not acid , but alkaline , producing in the body . it should in fact help to raise your ph and thereby to preserve bone and muscle.i ’ m perplexed by studies that find vegans have higher uric acid levels such as this one http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3572016 / whereas “ vegetarians ” have the lowest uric acid level of vegans , omnivores and vegetarians . a couple years esselstyn plant based and i still have high uric acid and urine ph = 6 and periodic gout attacks ( nipped in the bud with colchicine ) .interesting study . i hope dr. greger will address this sometime . the researchers speculate that the vegans had higher uric acid levels because of the lack of dairy and lower calcium intake in general , compared to the other groups.i had a problem with high levels of uric acid and severe gout but discovered high doses of niacin can cause it. discovered my multivitamin was loaded with niacin . i haven ’ t had my checked in a year , back then it was 9.0jack norris talks about the above study here : http : / / jacknorrisrd.com / higher-uric-acid-levels-in-vegans / maybe low b12 could cause higher uric acidyou could probably remedy this by supplementing your diet with potassium bicarbonate . a good one available online is called “ potassium basics . ” you can google it ; there are a couple of sites that carry it.i would recommend two capsules ( containing 2.7 grams of potassium bicarbonate ) with each meal 3 times a day for a total of 8.1 grams . the mineral compound potassium bicarbonate contains 39 % ( or 3.16 grams ) of elemental potassium . the rda for elemental potassium is 4.7 grams.this should raise your urine ph up to 7 or higher , especially if you continue with your plant-based diet.you can get the same results taking a potassium bicarbonate supplement as you can eating lots of fruits and vegetables , which are high in potassium citrate , since potassium citrate converts to potassium bicarbonate in the body . potassium bicarbonate has also been shown to preserve muscle mass ( along with preserving bone mineral density , e.g. , http : / / press.endocrine.org / doi … ) : dawson-hughes b , castaneda-sceppa c , harris ss , palermo nj , cloutier g , ceglia l , dallal ge . impact of supplementation with bicarbonate on lower-extremity muscle performance in older men and women . osteoporos int 2009 sep 1 .

[ 2 ] there is no evidence of human carcinogenicity , no adverse effects of overexposure , and an undetermined ld50 . physically , potassium bicarbonate occurs as a crystal or a soft white granular powder . potassium bicarbonate is very rarely found in its natural form , the mineral calledkalicinite . … potassium bicarbonate is an effective fungicide against powdery mildew and apple scab , allowed for use in organic farming . — maybe that is where it gets into coconuts from use as an anti-fungal agent , which would explain why some brands have more potassium than others ? hiwill the colour of my urine effect this test ( if i am more or less hydrated ( yellower / clearer ) ) ? dr. greger , is your 2011 article on optimum nutrition recommendations up-to-date ? if not , a refresher would be awesome , as a reference. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / dogulas : to my knowledge , dr. greger has not formally updated his official optimal nutrition recommendations since 2011 . in fact , i just got the latest volume 20 dvd ( excellent ! ) and it still had the recommendations insert for version 1.3 that i believe match the web page you linked to above.at one point dr. greger hinted that he was going to update his recommendations . i do not know what is up with that project ( change of mind on needing changes ? other priorities ? ) . so , i think the most we can do is continue to pay attention to the blog posts and adapt information from the videos as relevant . at some point , a new set of recommendations may appear.thanks very much ! do you happen to know if any of the recommendations have in fact changed much ? or dramatically ? i don ’ t want my family to be supplementing something that might be causing harm . there aren ’ t that many listed on that page . maybe you wouldn ’ t mind quickly glancing over the recommended doses ? douglas : to my knowledge , nothing has officially changed concerning those specific recommendations . however , from videos on this site , i know we can refine the information . for example , there is at least one nutritionfacts video where dr. greger recommend eating 2 tbl ground flaxseed every day . and if you have specific problems or goals , there can be specific recommendations . for example , suppose you had diabetes ? then i would recommend looking up the videos about diabetes to learn what foods might be especially important for managing that disease.that ’ s all i know.as a person train in laboratory techniques , this urine ph test really struck my funny bone . we both did the test today only using jelly jars , not the toilet bowl . my result was very acidic and my husband ’ s was acidic . i like dark green leafy ’ s but they do tend to be on our plates more seldom . that is changing ! kathy in missourii had a big smile reading your post . i think it is true dedication to science when a lady pees in a jelly jar . ; - ) ph test with fruit : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = lhlwwvs3w68is “ alkaline ” diet an abbreviated way of saying plant based , since sulfur is mostly ( or is it always ) in animal based products ? what is it about veggies that make them alkaline … simply the lack or sulfur ? i have been reading a lot of plant and gardening books lately , and it ’ s kind of interesting that most point out that most plants benefit from an acidic soil … which seems bit ironic. anthocyanins , beef , bone health , bone mineral density , cabbage , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , cost savings , dairy , eggs , fish , fruit , gout , greens , heart disease , heart health , kidney disease , kidney function , kidney health , kidney stones , lifespan , meat , milk , mortality , muscle health , muscle strength , omnivores , ph , plant protein , plant-based diets , pork , potassium , protein , quorn , seafood , standard american diet , stroke , tuna , uric acid , vegans , vegetable protein , vegetables , vegetarians - -
98	does animal protein cause osteoporosis ? for most of the last century , a prevailing theory within the field of nutrition was that by eating acid-forming foods such as meat , we were , in essence , at risk of peeing our bones down the toilet . and no wonder ! experiments dating back to 1920 showed over and over that if we add meat to our diet we get a big spike in the amount of calcium being lost in the urine . and this made total sense . we had known since 1912 that meat was acid-forming within the body , and how do we buffer acid ? what are in antacid ( anti-acid ) pills like tums ? calcium compounds . meat and eggs have a lot of sulphur-containing amino acids ( two to five times more than grains and beans ) that are metabolized into sulphuric acid , which the body buffers with calcium compounds . and where is calcium stored in the body ? the skeleton . so the thinking was that every time we ate a steak , our body would pull calcium from our bones , bit by bit , and over time this could lead to osteoporosis . based on 26 such studies , for every 40 grams of protein we add to our daily diet , we pee out an extra 50 mg of calcium . we only have about two pounds of calcium in our skeleton , so the loss of 50 milligrams a day would mean losing close to 2 % of our bone calcium every year . by the end of the 20th century , there was little doubt that acid-forming diets would dissolve our bones away . but if we actually look at the studies done on protein intake and bone health , that ’ s not what we find . so , where ’ s the flaw in the logic ? meat leads to acid , which leads to calcium loss , which leads to bone loss , right ? well , it ’ s uncontroversial that protein results in greater calcium excretion , but we ’ ve just been assuming it ’ s coming from the bone — where else could the extra calcium dumped in our urine be coming from but our bones ? one study appeared to solve the mystery . an intrepid group of researchers tried feeding a group of volunteers radioactive calcium and then put them on a high protein diet . what happens when we put people on a high protein diet ? the amount of calcium in their urine shoots up , and indeed that ’ s just what happened . but here ’ s the big question , was that extra calcium in their urine radioactive or not ? to everyone ’ s surprise , it was radioactive . this meant that the excess calcium in their urine was coming from their diet , not from their bones . what seemed to be happening is that the excess protein consumption boosted calcium absorption , from down around 19 % up to 26 % . all of a sudden there was all this extra calcium in the blood , so presumably the kidneys are like “ whoa , what are we going to do with it all ? ” so they dump it into the urine . 90 % of the extra calcium in the urine after eating a steak doesn ’ t appear to be coming from our bones but from our diet . we ’ re not sure why protein boosts calcium absorption . maybe protein increases the solubility of calcium by stimulating stomach acid production ? whatever the reason , there was indeed more calcium lost , but also more calcium gained such that in the end , most of that extra calcium is accounted for . in effect , more calcium is lost in the urine stream , but it may be compensated by less loss of calcium through the fecal stream . this was repeated with even more extreme diets — an acid-forming five-burgers-a-day-worth-of-animal protein diet that limited fruits and vegetables versus an alkaline diet emphasizing fruits and vegetables . more calcium in the urine on burgers , but significantly greater calcium absorption , such that at the end it was pretty much a wash . other studies have also since supported this interpretation . here ’ s an ingenious one : feed people a high animal protein diet but add in an alkali salt to neutralize the acid . the old thinking would predict that there would be no calcium loss since there is no excess acid to buffer , but no , even though the acid load was neutralized , there was still the excess urinary calcium , consistent with the radioactive isotope study , challenging the “ long-standing dogma that animal protein consumption results in a mild acidosis promoting the increased excretion of calcium . ” so if our body isn ’ t buffering the acid formed from our diet with our bones , how is it neutralizing the acid ? maybe with our muscles . alkaline diets may protect our muscle mass ! i cover that in my video testing your diet with pee and purple cabbage . now the boost in calcium absorption can only compensate if we ’ re taking enough in . for example , dietary acid load may be associated with lower bone mineral density in those getting under 800mg a day . plant protein is preferable to animal protein for a variety of reasons ( tends to have less methionine , is less igf-1 promoting , etc . ) , but it ’ s not clear how much of an advantage it has when it comes to bone health . i previously touched on this topic in my video is protein bad to the bone ? but i promised i ’ d take a deeper dive , hence my video alkaline diets , meat & calcium loss . -michael greger , m.d. how about the regulation of ca serum with the hormone pth and calcitonin ? pth releases calcium from the bone to restore the ca to a 8.8 – 10.2 mg / dl level , and also increases ca reabsorbtion from the intestines.thus , if the blood loses ca by peeing ( from high protein ) , then pth leeches it from the bones to restored it back to its normal level.10 years ago i was diagnosed with osteoporosis . my doc told me to read the china study ( ! ) , get off meat and dairy , and go to the gym and lift heavy weights . my next dexa 3 years later showed reversal of osteoporosis to osteopenia , and 3 years after that my bone density was even better . i have no idea if it was the heavy resistance training / weight bearing exercises or the vegan diet , so i keep doing the same thing.joann : re : the diet or the weight ? while i don ’ t have enough expertise to have a rigorous debate on the topic , i would say : both ! if nothing else , the whole plant food diet keeps you healthy in every other way so that you are healthy enough to lift the weights.just my thoughts on the matter . thanks for posting on this topic again . your story is important.thanks thea . i repeat my story because what i did worked so well for me in many areas , and maybe just one person will be helped.great ! you deserve a prize ! hey lets send your dr an award too ! i wish mine thought like that.what were you doing before that you stopped doing later … it could just as well be the stopping of bad habits as the starting of new proposed good habits . this is the problem with non-scientific anecdotal evidence . from your point of view , i think you are right to do what you are doing that has results … why worry about specifically what it is ? joann . i am a newby , cannot eat meat anyway as humans torture all living animls people eat . but i don ’ t know what to eat to fight osteopenia , which i have . as a newby , i ’ d like some simple things to eat . i ’ m not a cook , o simple is good . : ) try eating green leafy vegetables such as collards or kale . limiting sodium will lower calcium balance needs as well . spinach is not an efficient source of ca + due to oxalates . see here for more. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / laura , apart from avoiding all animal products which results in a more alkaline diet , and eating lots of vegetables , greens like kale and collards & legumes , increasing bone density requires resistance training / weight lifting / weight bearing exercises . we exercise the muscle , the tendon attached to that muscle pulls on the bone , and significant stress on the bone causes bone growth . squats , which can be weighted , are the best exercise for increasing the bone density of the neck of the femur . every muscle group needs to be worked – exercising the left leg does nothing for the right leg . the spine , hips and wrists are most vulnerable to fractures . i belong to a gym and use machines and free weights , but walking lunges , pushups , squats etc require no special equipment . getting a trainer to show you the correct form for all the exercises can be valuable and help prevent injury . you could eat the perfect diet but the exercise is critical . hope that ’ s of some help : ) laura : you have gotten two great replies already . i thought i would jump in with my own recommendation , which is to check out the book : “ building bone vitality , a revolutionayry diet plan to prevent bone loss and reverse osteoporosis ” . it ’ s a very compelling book and may help give you some confidence on which way to go with your diet.also , the exercise is covered in the book , but they give some really great tips on which exercises help and which do not.http : / / www.amazon.com / building-bone-vitality-revolutionary-osteoporosis – without / dp / 0071600191 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 ?

thanks ! never mind ! lol … i see my answer.after reading that it ’ s possible the body might take calcium from muscles for buffering , i ’ m wondering if leg cramps occurring with increasing frequency ( and that haven ’ t decreased in response to a magnesium supplement ) could be a possible manifestation of too much protein . i have a friend who has dealt with painful leg cramps for years . the cramps are increasing in frequency and the medical advice he ’ s been given thus far hasn ’ t helped.kwd : interesting thought . couldn ’ t hurt your friend to try a whole plant food based diet . like dr. greger is often pointing out when he discusses a study that is just a single study – well , if it doesn ’ t work , what are the side effects ?

let me guess the people who drink milk , right ? what is so hard about realizing you do not like milk , you just do not like it , why do you have to rationalize that everyone must dislike it , and seek to cherry pick and interpret studies to agree with you . it ’ s fine not to like milk ! don ’ t drink milk , but why lobby people to hate milk too ? no no ! that ’ s not what i meant . what i mean is , my bias gets in the way of researching this . i ’ m not trying to lobby anyone but myself . i want to know the scientific evidence behind consuming dairy products and if its beneficial or not . now if it is i ’ m still not going to consume it , but at least i can say honestly whether it ’ s good or not.and yes people who drink milk have the biggest bias , but they can do what they like . i ’ ve been off dairy for 10 years and i couldn ’ t be happier.i don ’ t think it ’ s biased to look at the fact , not opinion , that countries with the highest dairy consumption also have the highest rates of osteoporosis , and then make the decision to avoid dairy . i think that ’ s common sense.hey i agree ! but there are also other factors that may influence osteoporosis rates ie meat consumption , amount of vegetable consumption , tea consumption and junk consumption.but i agree there is no logic in drinking the excretion of another animal.and perhaps the biggest factor : inactivity , lack of weight-bearing / resistance exercise . that ’ s my primary motivation for my daily exercise routines . > > other factors that may influence osteoporosis rates ie meat consumption , dr. gregor just published a video that contradicted the idea that eating meat took calcium away from bones.but there are a lot of other things that those countries have in common as well as milk consumption . correlation does not imply cause , and that is what we still see here over and over . we do not understand all these things , so going around and looking for two graphs that have roughly the same shape and them conflating them together is the order of the day for selling paper and generating views and clicks , and that is the problem – how the economic world works . that is what brings us bad food and bad data.be careful , because two processes are correlated does not mean one causes the other . but at least it does mean that dairy is not protecting these populations.at this stage ron , all i personally need to know is that getting off meat and dairy and beginning resistance training actually reversed my osteoporosis and over the last 10 years , my bone density has been improving on this regimen . > > people who drink milk have the biggest bias , : - ) … funny , have you done any poll or have you any information as to the biases of people who drink milk or eat dairy products ? people have been doing that for thousands of years more or less . don ’ t you think it would shake out if people who drank milk got sick or died earlier than others in all that time.if you call doing what everyone else has been doing for ages a bias … but to me your statement seemed biased in such an oblivious way you don ’ t even see it … such a holier than thou attitude . at least that is how it sounds as i read it.personally i don ’ t drink much milk . i used to as a kid , and i don ’ t seek it out or avoid it . i grew up on it and i have good bones my doctors says.i said i had a bias , but i couldn ’ t give a hoot what you put in your mouth . i continue to question what goes into my diet . but how about stop attacking and offer something useful.you just see anything that questions of threatened your faith as not useful … it might be the most useful thing you need to consider.color me unconvinced that animal protein is not the culprit in osteoporosis.from ‘ the china study ’ , chart 10.2 : association of animal vs. plant protein intake and bone fracture rates for different countries shows that when vegetable-to-animal protein intake ratio drops below 1.0 the hip fracture rate ( incidence per 100,000 person-years ) zooms up over 75 to 200 . when the ratio is 2.0 or greater , the hip fracture rate is for the most part less than 25 . also , the study of osteoporotic fractures research group at the u. of california at san francisco published another study of over 1,000 women aged sixty-five and up . like the multi-country study , researchers characterized women ’ s diets by the proportions of animal and plant protein . after seven years of observations , the women with the highest ratio of animal protein to plant protein had 3.7 times more bone fractures than the women with the lowest ratio . also during this time the women with the high ratio lost bone almost four times as fast as the women with the lowest ratio.these are actual epidemiological observations , not theoretical lab results which must then be interpreted to fit the thesis.in the radioactive study , no surprise to find radioactive calcium in the urine . but how could you possibly sort out the non-radioactive calcium as it would be contaminated from the radioactive calcium , especially if it is supposedly a much smaller concentration level.quoting from dr. greger ’ s report above “ 90 % of the extra calcium in the urine after eating a steak doesn ’ t appear to be coming from our bones but from our diet . ” so where does the other 10 % come from … duh , perhaps our bones ! i am not sure why dr. greger isn ’ t asking the hard questions about the contradictions between actual population observations and these studies . and why doesn ’ t he ask the question about the missing 10 % ? he isn ’ t saying that meat eaters don ’ t have more osteoporosis he is saying that the calcium is coming from the meal and is peed out and not the bones . he isn ’ t questioning the observation from the china study . the mechanism is just different than we thought.maybe the mechanism is different , maybe not . it is not unexpected that the more calcium you intake the more you excrete . there is still the matter of the missing 10 % . its possible that the mechanism is analogous to losing water using a diuretic . you lose most of what you intake and a percentage already in the body.perhaps the dairy industry has gotten to the dr.perhaps it ’ s key to look at the muscle mass / bone density relationship . so if animal protein does not directly affect calcium loss on bones that was once thought , but directly and adversely affects muscle mass , that in turn would affect overall bone health.joann downey ivey ’ s experience is identical to mine – except i eat fish for b12 . it unfathomable for me to contemplate returning to dairy and red meat for it would mean a return of flatulence and lower energy . so , color me green . ; ) fascinating … and yet dr. neil barnard and others who gives these vegan lectures and interviews includes the eat eat protein , lose calcium meme in his talks . one of the things that knocked me out of taking these lectures so immediately seriously was the insistence that if you drank milk that because of the protein you would actually lose calcium . that could not be true , and yet some people really bought into this . now milk is not looking so bad except to fanatics that would eschew milk if it was found to be the the most healthful drink in nature.what looks … untenable … . is the hanging on every study or one single doctor ’ s interpretation of studies ( present company excepted , of course ) and trying to engineer one ’ s diet to optimization . there are a few cases where severe veganism is certainly indicated , such as massive arterial blockage , strokes , etc . i continue to speculate that the chemicals we put in our bodies to such a huge extent and grow plants in a monoculture and animals in factory farms nothing good can come from it.see the following studies showing that the alkaline mineral potassium bicarbonate ( khco3 ) attenuates bone loss . potassium citrate , found in abundance in fruits and vegetables , converts to potassium bicarbonate in the body ; therefore fruits and vegetables should have the same effect as khco3 if they ’ re consumed in sufficient quantities vis-a-vis acid-forming foods , such as meat , legumes and grains.improved mineral balance and skeletal metabolism in postmenopausal women treated with potassium bicarbonatehttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pu … treatment with potassium bicarbonate lowers calcium excretion and bone resorption in older men and womenhttp : / / press.endocrine.org / doi … long-term persistence of the urine calcium-lowering effect of potassium bicarbonate in postmenopausal womenhttp : / / press.endocrine.org / doi … i ’ ve improved my own bone mineral density over a two-year period as demonstrated via dexascan by supplementing my diet with khco3 along with ensuring that my urinary ph is kept sufficiently alkaline.journal of gerontology 55 ( 2000 ) “ a high ratio of plant to animal protein was impressively associated with a virtual disappearance of bone fractures ( in elderly women ) ” . amazing how many so-called osteoporosis specialists don ’ t read . also , in a plant-based diet , 500 mg of calcium per day has been shown to be adequate . of course , weight bearing exercise etc.why countries with highest consumption of meat and dairy have the highest level of osteoporosis ? parathyroid is responsible for calcium utilization . as you back up your lymph system with meat and ( even easier ) with dairy ( and / or other toxins ) the tissue around this blockage will start to collapse . i think this is # 1 reason for calcium loss ( havent found any others ) . as you move the lymph ( and have working kidneys ) toxins flow away and tissues regenerate.can you cover the studies on whey protein ? i ’ ve seen a great benefit in cancer protection in recent studies.hi chef . i think any of these isolates and concentrates are unnecessary , as whole foods are preferred . oncology populations differ , as survivors may not be able to eat by mouth or need additional nutrients to supplement their diet . some studies suggest whey and leucine-rich foods ( meat and milk ) stimulate the tor pathway , which dr. greger addresses in this video . whey protein is a highly concentrated source of animal protein , which can stimulate igf-1 production . similarly , concentrated / isolated soy protein supplements can also increase igf-1 . animal proteins are linked to increased risk of bone degeneration and kidney diseases . it may be that the ratio of animal to plant protein intake is important . in a paper i wrote about cancer prevention , applying the precautionary principle to nutrition and cancer i reference a study pointed out to me by dr. david jenkins about the overabbundance of amino acids ( reference 46 ) . for more studies on whey and cancer.so i ’ m confused . i was dx with osteoporosis 3 years ago . i have always walked and lifted moderate weights , so i went vegan . no change in the osteoporosis 3 years later . i ’ m postmenopausal 5 years , and 5ft and 100 lbs . what do i do now ? when you say you lift moderate weights , are you really putting significant strain on the muscles which then transfers to the tendon pulling on the bone enough to stimulate bone growth ? at 5 ’ 2 ″ and 110lb , i do weighted squats with 50 lb. for example . walking every day for a half hour , or even better an hour , is something i do in addition to the resistance training , but i use the walking as an extra , not the main exercise for prevention and reversal . i found it was a job in itself to be consistent in the daily exercise.i shall increase the weight , i ’ m lifting 30 lbs now . briefly , what weight bearing ex. do you do for hip and back ? agree on the walking , i do 3 miles of hills , tried a weighted vest for a month , but hurt my shoulders too much . scared people around me , sadly they thought it was an ammo vest ! ! thank you for your help.squats are touted as the # 1 exercise for increasing bone density of the neck of the femur . also do walking lunges , one leg squats holding trx , sled press , leg extensions , leg curls . for back … cable row , trx , low back hyperextension , lat pulldown , assisted chin-ups , rear delt flys . also do pushups , mountain climbers . that is a hoot about the vest – i get a few second glances : ) thank you , i have added those ! i am wondering now why there are studies ( or at least i ’ ve seen videos of people saying there are studies ) that say the countries / people / cultures that consume the most dairy have the highest rates of osteoporosis and bone fractuires ? dr. greger , is dr. mcdougall on board with your analysis ? i know he has been ( still is ? ) saying that animal protein increases the acidity of our blood , resulting in calcium being leached out , which leads to osteoporosis . see around minute 36 : 30 , for example : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = tjvrlwneqbshmm . i am not sure dr. mcdougall ’ s stance on this research . sorry , neil . at any rate — i think dr. mcdougall promotes a healthful diet as a physician . “ 90 % of the extra calcium in the urine after eating a steak doesn ’ t appear to be coming from our bones but from our diet . ” there ’ s enough calcium in steak to significantly increase calcium in the urine ? i think it has to do with the protein in the steak apparently increasing calcium absorption rather than the calcium in steak . you ’ re thinking right , no calcium in steak . well , about 6mg in a top round steak.dr greger / joseph gonzalez , are you not concerned that the second radioactive study was funded by the usda and the national cattlemen ’ s beef association . and whilst the first radioactive study was funded by the nih , most of the lead researcher ’ s funding in the past has come from the usda and the meat / dairy industries . it would also be good to get your response to ernest mayberry ’ s questions below , copied herein for your convenience : “ from ‘ the china study ’ , chart 10.2 : association of animal vs. plant protein intake and bone fracture rates for different countries shows that when vegetable-to-animal protein intake ratio drops below 1.0 the hip fracture rate ( incidence per 100,000 person-years ) zooms up over 75 to 200 . when the ratio is 2.0 or greater , the hip fracture rate is for the most part less than 25 . also , the study of osteoporotic fractures research group at the u. of california at san francisco published another study of over 1,000 women aged sixty-five and up . like the multi-country study , researchers characterized women ’ s diets by the proportions of animal and plant protein . after seven years of observations , the women with the highest ratio of animal protein to plant protein had 3.7 times more bone fractures than the women with the lowest ratio . also during this time the women with the high ratio lost bone almost four times as fast as the women with the lowest ratio.these are actual epidemiological observations , not theoretical lab results which must then be interpreted to fit the thesis.in the radioactive study , no surprise to find radioactive calcium in the urine . but how could you possibly sort out the non-radioactive calcium as it would be contaminated from the radioactive calcium , especially if it is supposedly a much smaller concentration level.quoting from dr. greger ’ s report above “ 90 % of the extra calcium in the urine after eating a steak doesn ’ t appear to be coming from our bones but from our diet . ” so where does the other 10 % come from … duh , perhaps our bones ! i am not sure why dr. greger isn ’ t asking the hard questions about the contradictions between actual population observations and these studies . and why doesn ’ t he ask the question about the missing 10 % ?

99	quadrupling breast cancer survival half a million americans are expected to die this year from cancer , equal to five jumbo jets crashing every day . the number of americans who die from cancer each year is more than all those who have died in all u.s. wars combined . and this happens every single year . after a cancer diagnosis people tend to clean up their diets . about a third to a half of breast cancer patients , for example , make healthy dietary changes following diagnosis , such as increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and decreasing meat , fat , and sugar intakes . does it actually help that late in the game ? well , the women ’ s healthy eating and living study was undertaken in a few thousand breast cancer survivors to determine if a plant-based , low-fat , high-fiber diet could influence breast cancer recurrence rates and survival . previously they famously reported that simple changes — five or more servings of fruits and veggies a day and just walking 30 minutes a day six days a week — were associated with a significant survival advantage , cutting the risk of death nearly in half . note : it was fruits and veggies and exercise . in the video , breast cancer survival vegetable , you can see the proportion of women with breast cancer surviving nine years in the study if they had low fruit and vegetable consumption and low physical activity , compared to those high in one and low in the other , compared to the survival curve of those high in both . and it worked just as well in women with estrogen receptor negative tumors , which normally have twice the mortality — unless women eat those few fruits and veggies and take a few strolls . imagine , for a second , you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with breast cancer . imagine sitting in that chair , in the doctor ’ s office , as your doctor gives you the news . but , she says , there ’ s a new experimental treatment that can cut your chances of dying in the next few years from 16 percent down to just 4 percent . to quadruple their survival rate , many women would re-mortgage their homes to fly to some quack clinic in mexico and would lose all their hair to chemo , but most , apparently , couldn ’ t stand the thought of eating broccoli . the women ’ s healthy eating and living study found that while fruits and vegetables in general may be good , cruciferous vegetables may be better . for women on tamoxifen , for example , women who consumed one of their five daily servings of fruits and veggies as broccoli , cauliflower , collards , cabbage , or kale had their risk of cancer recurrence cut in half . i recommend that all women with breast cancer eat broccoli sprouts . see my 8-part video series : 1 . dna protection from broccoli 2 . sulforaphane : from broccoli to breast 3 . broccoli versus breast cancer stem cells 4 . liver toxicity due to broccoli juice ? 5 . how much broccoli is too much ? 6 . the best detox 7 . sometimes the enzyme myth is true 8 . biggest nutrition bang for your buck they may also help out with other cancers ( lung cancer metastases and broccoli and raw broccoli and bladder cancer survival ) . for more on breast cancer survival , see : what ’ s even better is preventing breast cancer in the first place . here are the 10 latest videos , but there are 81 other videos on breast cancer : some of this video may sound familiar — i included it in my 2013 live presentation , which you can watch here . we were fortunate to attend healthy taste of ventura just five months after my wife was diagnosed with triple positive , stage iib breast cancer in 2012 . she had a very simple lumpectomy without lymph node dissection and clear margins but chose not to have chemo , radiation or drugs . although she was already cancer free just two months after surgery , we immediately switched to a plant based diet after hearing dr gregor ’ s research . she remains cancer free 19 months later.wonderful news and thanks for posting . dr. m ’ s last statement is true : people would rather have chemo , take drugs , et al , than eat vegetables . strange . my best wishes to you both and your post will be passed on.great article and information ! i so appreciate your website and research , dr. gregor . i switched to an entirely vegan , whole food , plant based diet after treatment for breast cancer . it has been nearly 3 years now … my health has been amazing since the change . i feel at least 10 years younger – and have had a bunch of other health issues disappear – psoriatic arthritis , for one . i am told that i look amazing , too : ) thank you again ! the study was based on women who take tamoxifen and adopt a plant-based diet . any research on survival rate for those of us who have not chosen to take tamoxifen , yet have changed to a plant-based diet and exercise daily ? great question ! i heard recently they are now suggesting even longer periods of tamoxifen use from 5 years previously to 10 years for most people regardless of vegan or not . i doubt there are any studies on exercising vegans not taking tamoxifen compared to general population taking tamoxifen , although that would be so interesting ! i could not locate any info on sugar and cancer . some say sugar feeds cancer , do the studies show this to be ?

100	cancer and the animal-to-plant protein ratio it is now eight years since the famous ornish study was published , suggesting that 12 months on a strictly plant-based diet could reverse the progression of prostate cancer . for those unfamiliar with that landmark ornish study , see cancer reversal through diet ? , which the pritikin foundation followed up on with ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay . wait a second . how were they able to get a group of older men to go vegan for a year ? they home delivered prepared meals to their doors , i guess figuring men are so lazy they ’ ll just eat whatever is put in front of them . but what about out in the real world ? realizing that we can ’ t even get most men with cancer to eat a measly five servings of fruits and veggies , in a study profiled in my video , prostate cancer survival : the a / v ratio , researchers settled on just trying to change their a to v ratio — the ratio of animal to vegetable proteins — and indeed were successful in cutting this ratio by at least half , from about two to one animal to plant , to kind of half vegan , one to one . how ’ d the men do ? their cancer appeared to slow down . the average psa doubling time ( an estimate of how fast the tumor may be doubling in size ) in the “ half vegan ” group slowed from 21 months to 58 months . so the cancer kept growing , but with a part-time plant-based diet they were able to slow down the tumor ’ s expansion . what ornish got , though , was an apparent reversal in cancer growth — the psa didn ’ t just rise slower , it trended down , which could be an indication of tumor shrinkage . so the ideal a to v ratio may be closer to zero . if there ’ s just no way grandpa ’ s going vegan , and we just have half-measures , which might be the worst a and the best v ? eggs and poultry may be the worst , respectively doubling and potentially quadrupling the risk of cancer progression in a study out of harvard . twice the risk eating less than a single egg a day and up to quadruple the risk eating less than a single daily serving of chicken or turkey . and if we could only add one thing to our diet , what would it be ? cruciferous vegetables . less than a single serving a day of either broccoli , brussels sprouts , cabbage , cauliflower , or kale may cut the risk of cancer progression ( defined as the cancer coming back , spreading to the bone , or death ) by more than half . the animal to plant ratio might be useful for cancer prevention as well . for example , in the largest study ever performed on diet and bladder cancer , just a 3 % increase in the consumption of animal protein was associated with a 15 % higher risk of bladder cancer , whereas a 2 % increase in plant protein intake was associated with a 23 % lower risk . even little changes in our diets can have significant effects . what else might help men with prostate cancer ? see flaxseed vs. prostate cancer and saturated fat & cancer progression . what about preventing it in the first place ? see : poultry and eggs may be related to cancer risk in a variety of ways : crucifers may also help with other cancers . see : breast cancer is highlighted in my video breast cancer survival vegetable . i dislike being a nitpicker here , because i know what dr. greger is saying , but calling someone a “ half vegan ” is like calling someone a “ half racist ” or , to be more apropos , a “ half slaver ” . being that a vegan is one who stands up against the exploitation of others and thus there is no room for half measures . now , saying someone is half plant-powered , plant-based , etcetera is much more fitting . : - ) wow . way to combine the most fanatical components of veganism and political correctness . get a fucking life.i agree “ half-vegan ” is probably a bad term . i would go with “ half-plant-based ” , but that is a mouth-full ! i ’ m assuming that the eggs and poultry mentioned in paragraph 5 were not organic ? i wonder if eating eggs from your own chickens and poultry that is free-range with non-soy feed would have the same negative effects ? i always look for broccoli with buds that are deep green , not yellowish like in the above photo . that broccoli looks kinda elderly . oh , right , it was the lighting . : - ) imagine the irony of reading this in your urologist ’ s office for your very first biopsy 2.5 years after going full on plants because the new phi test says you might have pca – here ’ s hoping dr. greger is right and my body just had the good sense to balk at the dimbulb tests ! good luck ! eating healthy is not a guarantee , but it does improve your risks dramatically . i ’ ll think good thoughts for you.thanks thea . really mixed feelings at this point . in one sense there is no way to avoid embarrassment here – either i undertook this very painful test for no reason ( distrusting the program ) , or went vegan for no apparent health benefit . on the other hand , it will be awesome to learn it was nothing , or a comfort knowing that it probably would have been much worse.any idea how much flax you should take if you have prostate cancer ? in the cited study it was 3 tablespoons of ground flax per day . cruciferous veggies and allium ( onion garlic etc ) and fenugreek also looked helpful . orange bell peppers and lutein as in tomatoes and green tea and whole soy ( tofu is good isolate is not ) and mushrooms and pecans walnuts and peanuts have also been mentioned.jamaican allspice vs. pca ! http : / / med.miami.edu / news / miller-school-researchers-discover-prostate-cancer-fighting-compound-in-alldr greger , please respond to this.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22254011it does not look like the evidence is very strong for flax as prostate cancer inhibitor.great article , some of the questions i have been interested in were answered , but very explicitly . > > the psa didn ’ t just rise slower , it trended down , which could be an indication of tumor shrinkage . so the ideal a to v ratio may be closer to zero.what is “ psa ” , i don ’ t see it defined anywhere in the article ? are there any studies that qualify how many veggies of what sort or how little animal products of what sort to eat to get this effect ? the cruciferous veggies are specifically mentioned , but at what dose . for a regular diet it seems really odd to mention eating 3 tablespoons of flax and things like that for an otherwise healthy person , i don ’ t think many will do that , and it is expensive and time consuming.one other thing is why are only certain cancers mentioned of studies … are we expected to eat some new kind of weird stuff to reduce the chances of getting every different kind of cancer is there an “ anti-cancer diet ” that will help with all cancers ? psa stands for prostate specific antigen which is produced by both normal and cancerous prostate cells . although the cancerous cells produce twice as much per cell … hence the stated “ usefulness ” in using the test to screen for the disease . unfortunately inflammation and infection in the prostate can cause elevation and the % of men with the disease is quite high . i would suggest you read dr. greger ’ s post … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / vegetables / and more specifically to answer your question about vegetable selection see video : # 1 anticancer vegetable … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / 1-anticancer-vegetable / or http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / veggies-vs-cancer / .at this point it seems that the best “ anticancer ” diet would be a whole food vegan diet with adequate intake of vitamin b12 . you should consume a variety of vegetables.the risk of cancer with consumption of animal products seems to be linear such that less is always better . of course most of our exposure to carcinogens especially dioxin like compounds comes from meat , dairy and fish . by going to browse all topics you can view any of the 58 video ’ s on carcinogens . you need to keep tuned in to nutritionfacts as the science keeps coming . good luck.ornish is ok with egg whites , dairy , fish oil , and fish consumption.when i have heard dr. ornish speak in the last 2 years he seems to be sticking with fish oil despite the lack of science supporting its use . i am not aware of any studies which support the use of egg whites , dairy and fish for improving your odds of avoiding early death or disability.i highly doubt dr. ornish would make a recommendation to consume fish oil , egg whites , or some dairy without referencing studies and science supporting the benefits.as far as avoiding early death … .how do you explain this from dr. greger himself ? he admits vegans don ’ t live longer than meat eaters.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = q7kerwdih04there are always exceptions . one reported case was a patient born with abnormalities in their coronary arteries which predisposed him to an early heart attack . by consuming the correct diet you improve the odds for delaying death and avoiding chronic diseases . the original studies by ornish and esselstyn were done in the early 1990 ’ s and we have learned alot since those studies . the best results have now been shown by dr. esselstyn in his recent report on long term follow up of almost 200 patients . if you view the videos on this website re : fish oil , dairy and eggs and come to the conclusion that they are healthy foods then we will just be in disagreement . that said if you can find good scientific studies that show the benefits of fish oil , dairy , etc . i would be glad to read them . since the science keeps changing we should be ready to shift our beliefs . so you need to keep tuned to nf.org.i am more focused at the 5 : 19 mark of dr. greger ’ s video where he referenced the harvard study on vegetarian mortality . 8,000 people over 18 years . found no difference vs. meat eaters . his jaw dropped as mine did when i first watched this video.vegetarian is definitely not the same as eating a carefully planned whole foods plant based diet . probably even most vegans dont . so it is difficult to conclude on a wfpd from studies where people claim to be vegetarian.other studies have shown that vegetarians live 7 years longer than meat eaters , and vegans live longer than vegetarians . the minority of studies that show vegetarianism in a negative light are always the ones that gain the most publicity . a / v ratio , aging , animal products , animal protein , bladder cancer , bladder disease , bladder health , broccoli , brussels sprouts , cabbage , cance , cauliflower , chicken , cruciferous vegetables , dr. dean ornish , eggs , fruit , harvard , kale , men 's health , metastases , mortality , plant protein , plant-based diets , poultry , prostate cancer , prostate health , protein , psa , r cancer survival , turkey , vegans , vegetable protein , vegetables , vegetarians - -
